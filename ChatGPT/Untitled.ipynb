      "Title:  Alzheimer's drug lecanemab receives accelerated FDA approval amid safety concerns\n",
      "News:  CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "The US Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval Friday for the Alzheimer’s disease drug lecanemab, one of the first experimental dementia drugs to appear to slow the progression of cognitive decline.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alzheimer’s disease immeasurably incapacitates the lives of those who suffer from it and has devastating effects on their loved ones,” Dr. Billy Dunn, director of the Office of Neuroscience in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. “This treatment option is the latest therapy to target and affect the underlying disease process of Alzheimer’s, instead of only treating the symptoms of the disease.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lecanemab will be marketed as Leqembi, the FDA statement said. It has shown “potential” as an Alzheimer’s disease treatment by appearing to slow progression, according to Phase 3 trial results, but it has raised safety concerns due to its association with certain serious adverse events, including brain swelling and bleeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "In July, the FDA accepted Eisai’s Biologics License Application for lecanemab under the accelerated approval pathway and granted the drug priority review, according to the company. The accelerated approval program allows for earlier approval of medications that treat serious conditions and “fill an unmet medical need” while the drugs continue to be studied in larger and longer trials.\n",
      "\n",
      "If those trials confirm that the drug provides a clinical benefit, the FDA could grant traditional approval. But if the confirmatory trial does not show benefit, the FDA has the regulatory procedures that could lead to taking the drug off the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is known about lecanemab\n",
      "\n",
      "Lecanemab, a monoclonal antibody, is not a cure but works by binding to amyloid beta, a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. In late November, results from an 18-month Phase 3 clinical trial published in The New England Journal of Medicine showed that lecanemab “reduced markers of amyloid in early Alzheimer’s disease and resulted in moderately less decline on measures of cognition and function than placebo at 18 months but was associated with adverse events.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The results also showed that about 6.9% of the trial participants given lecanemab, as an intravenous infusion, discontinued the trial due to adverse events, compared with 2.9% of those given a placebo. Overall, there were serious adverse events in 14% of the lecanemab group and 11.3% of the placebo group.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most common adverse events in the lecanemab group were reactions to the intravenous infusions and abnormalities on their MRIs, such as brain swelling and bleeding called amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA, which can become life-threatening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some people who get ARIA may not have symptoms, but it can occasionally lead to hospitalization or lasting impairment. And the frequency of ARIA appeared to be higher in people who had a gene called APOE4, which can raise the risk of Alzheimer’s disease or other dementias. ARIA “were numerically less common” among APOE4 noncarriers, the study showed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The drug’s prescribing information carries a warning about ARIA, the FDA says.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trial results also showed that about 0.7% of participants in the lecanemab group and 0.8% of those in the placebo group died, corresponding to six deaths in the lecanemab group and seven in the placebo group.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Alzheimer’s Association welcomed Friday’s decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "“By slowing progression of the disease when taken in the early stages of Alzheimer’s, individuals will have more time to participate in daily life and live independently,” President and CEO Joanne Pike said. “This could mean more months of recognizing their spouse, children and grandchildren. This could also mean more time for a person to drive safely, accurately and promptly take care of family finances, and participate fully in hobbies and interests.”\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 6.5 million people in the United States live with Alzheimer’s disease, according to the Alzheimer’s Association, and that number is expected to grow to 13.8 million by 2060.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will Medicare cover it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Lecanemab will carry a wholesale price of $26,500 per patient per year, the drug’s manufacturers announced Friday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biogen and Eisai have listed the drug slightly below the reduced price of the Alzheimer’s medication Aduhelm, which now costs an average patient about $28,200. The companies had to lower the cost of Aduhelm – originally set at $56,000 per patient per year – after insurers balked at covering it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In justifying the cost of Leqembi, the companies said in a news release that based on the estimated quality of life gained by people who take it, the value of the medication to society is around $37,000 a year, but they chose to go lower “aiming to promote broader patient access, reduce overall financial burden, and support health system sustainability.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The wholesale cost of a drug is akin to a car’s sticker price. It isn’t necessarily what patients will pay after insurance or other discounts are factored in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Insurance coverage for this medication is not a given, however. Medicare restricted its coverage of lecanemab’s sister drug, Aduhelm, after clinical trials showed questionable benefits to patients. The agency agreed to cover the drug only for people enrolled in registered clinical trials, which limited access to the medication.\n",
      "\n",
      "Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure said after the FDA’s decision Friday that her office would quickly review Leqembi, but for now, because of its accelerated approval, it will be covered the same way Aduhelm is covered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At CMS, we will continue to expeditiously review the data on these products as they become available and are committed to timely access to treatments, including drugs, that improve clinically meaningful outcomes,” Brooks-LaSure said in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last month, the Alzheimer’s Association filed a formal request asking CMS to provide “full and unrestricted coverage” Alzheimer’s treatments approved by the FDA.\n",

      "Title:  Some major pharmacies are planning to dispense abortion pills, but not in every state\n",
      "News:  CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "After a change to US Food and Drug Administration rules, major pharmacy chains CVS and Walgreens say they plan to seek certification to distribute abortion pills where legally allowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FDA said on its website Tuesday that pharmacies that become certified to dispense mifepristone, which may be used in a medication abortion, can do so directly to someone who has a prescription from a certified prescriber.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time, this allows outpatient pharmacies to dispense mifepristone, said Lewis Grossman, a professor of law at the American University Washington College of Law.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that doesn’t mean all pharmacies will dispense the medication.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In terms of whether or not that is going to have any impact in states where abortion is banned, I think the answer is probably not,” Grossman said. “I don’t see any real effect there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not clear which other pharmacies will seek certification or what impact it will have on abortion access in places where it’s banned or restricted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s not at all clear that many or all or most pharmacies, or pharmacies in more rural areas, or pharmacies in red states will do so in ways that meaningfully increases access to medication abortion,” Leah Litman, a professor of law at the University of Michigan, said in an email Wednesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, “mail order pharmacies have already been dispensing pills with the FDA’s permission,” she wrote. “So the possibility of getting medication abortion existed before this latest decision.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A different standard\n",
      "\n",
      "In a medication abortion, mifepristone is used with another drug called misoprostol to end a pregnancy. Mifepristone blocks a hormone called progesterone that is needed for a pregnancy to continue. Misoprostol can already be distributed by pharmacies.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement Wednesday, Walgreens said it is “working through the registration, necessary training of our pharmacists, as well as evaluating our pharmacy network in terms of where we normally dispense products that have extra FDA requirements and will dispense these consistent with federal and state laws.”\n",
      "\n",
      "CVS said in a statement, “We plan to seek certification to dispense mifepristone where legally permissible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Honeybee Health, an online pharmacy company that had been supplying and shipping abortion medications, posted on its verified Facebook page Tuesday that it “officially became the first pharmacy certified to dispense medication abortion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The online pharmacy can distribute the pills only in states where it’s allowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At the onset of the pandemic, Honeybee Health quickly became the first digital pharmacy to supply and ship medication abortion. We are proud to partner with the majority of telemedicine abortion providers in the US and to work closely with our manufacturer to help set the high standards required for certification in response to the FDA’s adjustment to the REMS program,” the Facebook post says. REMS refers to the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program for mifepristone.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for many pharmacies, it will take some time to review and decide whether to undergo the certification process – and the certification process may be complicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mifepristone is not the kind of drug for which any kind of pharmacy certification is normally required,” Grossman said. “And this particular pharmacy certification regime seems much more onerous than one would expect for a random drug with a similar safety profile.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists said in a statement that “FDA’s change does not mandate that pharmacies must stock or dispense mifepristone, nor does it supersede any state laws that restrict prescribing or dispensing of the medication.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Affect on abortion access\n",
      "\n",
      "There are questions remaining about how the changes might affect the abortion access landscape, Litman said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s not clear that the latest FDA move means that states couldn’t enforce different abortion restrictions against doctors who prescribe medication abortion, or pharmacists who fulfill prescriptions, or people who take medication abortion to induce an abortion,” she said. Additionally, it’s not clear whether someone living in a state with abortion restrictions can use telehealth services to get a prescription for mifepristone and have it delivered through the mail.\n",
      "\n",
      "In places where abortion was banned or heavily restricted before the FDA update, it remains banned or restricted, said Elizabeth Nash, a principal policy associate of state issues at the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive-health nonprofit.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The FDA’s change in allowing dispensing at pharmacies means that there are more options for access for people in states where abortion is not heavily regulated and abortion rights are protected. Where abortion has been banned, abortion remains banned,” Nash said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What we are seeing now is that if a state has banned abortion, then medication abortion is unavailable. And I think we’re going to see how this tension plays out between the FDA’s authority over drugs and devices and the state laws,” she said. “We may see some court cases around this very issue as to FDA’s authority and state law.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Andrea Miller, president of the advocacy group National Institute for Reproductive Health, praised the FDA’s changes, calling them an “important step forward” in terms of increasing access to abortion medication – but she said there is “an unfortunate reality.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The unfortunate reality is that there are more than a dozen states right now where abortion is illegal or close to fully illegal, it is banned. And unfortunately, just like people are forced to do now, it is likely that some people in states where abortion is banned may choose to travel to another state to seek medication abortion,” Miller said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We don’t believe that anyone should be forced to travel in that way, and certainly, as this moves forward, there are a lot of very smart lawyers who are looking at the question of how they’ll be incorporated into drugstores and pharmacy chains, and where that can happen – and how these different federal and state provisions interplay,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FDA’s pharmacy certification for mifepristone requires pharmacies to track shipments and to keep records of prescribers, recipients and lot numbers of each drug dispensed. This “inhibits the creation of a secondary distribution network for this drug,” Grossman said, such as if people in a state with access send the drug to those in abortion-restriction states.\n",
      "\n",
      "Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n",
      "\n",
      "He asked, “Would a state that was prosecuting somebody for diversion have access to those records? Because if they do, then that is a disincentive to providing it to people in states that are banning it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether states can enforce restrictive abortion laws against people who “provide, facilitate access to, or obtain medication abortion” to someone in another state or within a state depends in part on a doctrine known as preemption, under which a state law that undermines the purpose or objectives of federal law cannot be enforced, Litman said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the current political climate, “it’s far from clear” whether the US Supreme Court would say the FDA’s recent actions “preempt” state laws restricting access to medication abortion, Litman said, or that state laws are preempted to the extent they regulate medication abortion.\n",

      "“That athlete is someone’s child. Could that be my child?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Cardiac events during sports are uncommon for anyone, said Dr. Stuart Berger, division head of cardiology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. While they can also occur in kids and teens, these injuries can happen whether or not people play sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "While many children can get injured on the field, the numbers are mostly declining – and sports are important for their physical and mental health, doctors say. They explain how to prevent and treat sports injury in kids.\n",
      "\n",
      "How many kids get injured playing sports\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall injuries due to youth participation in football show a dramatic decline since 2013, plateauing in 2020 and heading back up in 2021, according to the most recent figures from the US Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than a million kids ages 5 to 14 were injured in sports and required a trip to the emergency room, according to the commission. Along with sports like basketball, soccer and football, the agency also reported significant injuries from things like playground equipment and skateboards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Children between the ages of 5 and 14 were most likely to be injured in football in 2021: There were 110,171 reported injuries in children ages 5 to 14 in 2021, compared to 92,802 in youth and young adults aged 15 to 24.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soccer and basketball were also high risk for kids’ injuries with 59,000 and 79,207 injuries, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sports with the highest rates of concussion were: boys’ football, with 10.4 concussions per 10,000 athlete exposures; girls’ soccer, with 8.19 per 10,000 athlete exposures; and boys’ ice hockey, with 7.69 per 10,000 athlete exposures, according to a 2019 study.\n",
      "\n",
      "High contact sports like hockey, football, lacrosse and martial arts might be higher risk for serious injuries such as head injury, but even seemingly safer sports like swimming and track pose some risk for overuse injuries. And they all can be made safer with the right strategy, said Dr. Erin Grieb, pediatric primary care sports medicine physician at Stanford Medicine Children’s Orthopedic and Sports Medicine Center.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s what to do if your child plays sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "What to look out for\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to cardiac events, screening is crucial, Berger said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally, kids are safe to play sports and exercise without concern for cardiac events, but with all types of sports, it is important to do a physical with family history to identify those who might be at risk, he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The concerns are that maybe there is somebody with an underlying cardiac abnormality,” Berger said. “The screening is designed to bring that out and that we can identify, if possible, who those kids are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Head injuries are another major concern to families when it comes to putting their children in sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bulk of concussions in kids are related to youth sports, said Dr. Andrew Peterson, clinical professor of pediatrics and director of primary care sports medicine at the University of Iowa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The good news is that there is not strong evidence that a handful of concussions over a childhood is associated with long term impacts as an adult, he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it is really important to avoid reinjuring the head before a concussion is fully healed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The thing we worry about most are these second impact events where people have a concussion on top of a concussion,” Peterson said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coaches, referees and families should learn how to spot a concussion to make sure their young athlete is properly cared for, Grieb said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The signs and symptoms can be physical, including headaches or sensitivity to light; mental, with confusion or difficulty paying attention; emotional, with sadness and anxiety; or sleep related, she added.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to remember that concussions can present in many ways, and just because you got certain symptoms in one concussion doesn’t mean you will have the same ones in the next, Grieb said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proper techniques, well-fiting gear and adherance to the rules are important to safety, Grieb said. monkeybusinessimages/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n",
      "\n",
      "Prevention and response\n",
      "\n",
      "To keep kids safe in sports, it’s important focus on both prevention and response.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even for high contact, high-risk sports, there has been a cultural shift to focus more rules and regulations on player protection and injury prevention, Grieb said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Learning the proper techniques and wearing well-fitting gear can help lower the risk of serious injury in sports like football, hockey and lacrosse.\n",
      "\n",
      "In almost any sport, kids should be given ample time to rest within the week and over the course of the year to avoid injuries that can come from overuse, she added.\n",
      "\n",
      "With head injuries, it is important that young athletes take the proper time and action to recover before getting back to their sports, Grieb said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You break a bone, I can put you in a cast and not let you use that arm. When you have a head injury, I can’t put your head in a cast,” she said. “You get one brain, so it’s really important that we let your brain heal.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to cardiac event, every person – player, coach or onlooker – should be familiar with CPR, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and how to use a defibrillator, Berger said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be prepared to intervene, because that’s what saves lives,” he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why children should still play\n",
      "\n",
      "The takeaway message should not be to keep your kids from sports, Berger said.\n",
      "\n",
      "There might be a conversation with your child about what sports they want to do, along with the risks and precautions your family will take, Grieb said, but it doesn’t have to be all or nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sports and other physical activities for kids are important for building good habits to keep moving throughout their lifetime, Peterson said. And regular movement is part of growing up in a safe and healthy way, he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "But sports also give our kids leadership skills, life lessons and fun, Grieb said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you’re focused on using proper techniques, you’re focused on following the rules of the game and you have coaches and referees who are also engaged in that, then I think particularly risky sports can be safer than they have in the past,” she said.\n"

      "\n",
      "If you suspect that someone has gone into cardiac arrest, there are some simple steps you can take right away that could mean the difference between life and death.\n",
      "\n",
      "About 70% to 90% of people who go into cardiac arrest in the US die before they get to a hospital because the people around them don’t always know how to help.\n",
      "\n",
      "What cardiac arrest looks like\n",
      "\n",
      "Cardiac arrest is when a person’s heart abruptly stops beating.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The most common rhythm that you’ll see is something called ventricular fibrillation, which is basically like the heart is like a bag of worms. It’s beating chaotically, and it’s no longer able to effectively pump,” said Dr. Christine Albert, director of the Cardiology Department at the Smidt Heart Institute in Los Angeles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The person collapses because the brain is no longer working, and there’s just a couple of minutes that you have to try to get that rhythm back to a normal rhythm.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Warning signs can include shortness of breath, a pounding heart, weakness and chest discomfort. But more often than not, cardiac arrest happens without warning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Someone who’s in cardiac arrest will not have a pulse and won’t respond to sound or touch. They’ll either stop breathing or make gasping-like sounds, which aren’t true breathing but a reflex that happens when the brain isn’t getting enough oxygen.\n",
      "\n",
      "What causes cardiac arrest\n",
      "\n",
      "Cardiac arrest can be caused by irregular heart rhythms called arrhythmias. Heart failure can cause it, as can thickening of the heart muscle called cardiomyopathy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cardiac arrest can follow a heart attack, which is when a blockage keeps the heart from getting enough blood. The muscle starts to die, but unlike with cardiac arrest, it will continue to pump.\n",
      "\n",
      "It might also happen because of electrocution, drowning, choking, respiratory distress or trauma. A hard strike to the chest, as for a baseball player, could knock the heart out of rhythm.\n",
      "\n",
      "What to do first: Call 911, use an AED\n",
      "\n",
      "If you see someone with symptoms of cardiac arrest, call 911 immediately. You want to get professional help there as quickly as possible. When the heart can’t pump blood to the brain and the lungs, the person may become brain-damaged or die within minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "If someone else is around, divide the duties. One person should call 911 while the other looks for an automated external defibrillator, or AED.\n",
      "\n",
      "Defibrillators are often available in public places like airports. Andrulik/Adobe Stock\n",
      "\n",
      "These lightweight devices can jolt a person’s heart back into regular rhythm. They’re often found in public places like airports, offices and schools. An AED may look daunting, but it’s designed for use by anyone, even untrained bystanders.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you press the power button, the device will give you step-by-step voice instructions on where to put the electrode pads on the person’s chest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the pads are in place, the device measures the person’s heart rhythm. It won’t deliver a shock if the person doesn’t need one. But if they do, the AED will tell you to stand back and push a button to deliver the shock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Start CPR\n",
      "\n",
      "After using the AED – or right away, if you don’t have access to one – start chest compressions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Put your hands in the center of the person’s chest and press hard at 100 to 120 beats per minute. It may help to hum a song with this tempo like “Stayin’ Alive” by the Bee Gees, Justin Timberlake’s “Can’t Stop the Feeling” or Lady Gaga’s “Just Dance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are literally acting like an external heart,” said Dr. Comilla Sasson, a practicing emergency medicine physician and vice president for science and innovation for emergency cardiovascular care with the American Heart Association.\n",
      "\n",
      "It can get tiring, she said, so if someone else is nearby, have them take over when you need a break. If they don’t know CPR, have them watch you first. “That’s what we do in the emergency room,” Sasson said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Locking your elbows gives you more leverage to push. With an adult, you’d typically use both hands for the chest compressions. But if you’re helping a baby, use one hand.\n",

There’s a small number of people that get a broken rib,” Sasson said.\n",

      "\n",
      "More than 100 million cases have been reported in the United States since the start of the pandemic. However, the actual number of cases is likely much higher, as many individuals who are infected do not test or do not report the results of tests taken at home.

      "\n",
      "For the first time since 2012, the US Environmental Protection Agency is proposing an update to the federal air quality standard for fine soot – a long-awaited step to reduce deadly air pollution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current standard, which has been in place for more than a decade, limits the average annual amount of fine particle pollution to 12 micrograms per cubic meter of air. The EPA is proposing reducing that limit to 9 to 10 micrograms, though it will be taking public comment on a range as low as 8 and as high as 11 migrograms per cubic meter. The final standard will be a single digit somewhere in that range.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fine particulate matter – called PM2.5 – pollutes outdoor air by the burning of fossil fuels like gasoline, diesel and oil, as well as wood. It is the tiniest pollutant yet among the most dangerous. When inhaled, it travels deep into lung tissue, where it can enter the bloodstream and can contribute to cardiovascular disease, asthma and other respiratory illnesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exposure to this pollution has also been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer in people who have never smoked. Scientists recently found a possible mechanism for that increased risk – some air pollution particles may promote mutations in cells in the airways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the significant health risk, the World Health Organization in 2021 recommended that environmental agencies cut the allowable limit to 5 micrograms per cubic meter of air. Doing so, the organization said, could reduce deaths associated with fine particle pollution by as much as 80%, though there is no amount of air pollution that is completely safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though it’s stronger than previous standards, the EPA proposal falls short of the WHO recommendation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harold Wimmer, the president and CEO of the American Lung Association, said the proposal “misses the mark and is inadequate to protect public health.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Particle pollution kills,” Wimmer said in a statement. He said the EPA should follow the guidance of medical experts and implement a limit of 8 micrograms per cubic meter. He also noted that a stronger rule is needed for the average daily limit – from the current 35 micrograms per cubic meter to 25. The EPA said it is taking public comment that potential change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wimmer said health organizations are “united” on this ask.\n",

      "Dr. Doris Browne, an oncologist and the president of the National Medical Association, said the EPA’s proposal “will have a lasting impact,” especially on communities of color.\n",

      "“I’ve spent my career advocating for health equity and environmental justice, because no one should be sickened by the environment in which they live,” Browne told reporters. “Harmful carbon pollution and smog have a lasting and devastating impact on public health, and strengthening air quality standards means healthier, more sustainable communities.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The EPA is required by law to update the standards for fine particulate pollution every five years and according to the latest available science. The last time they were updated under the Obama administration in 2012, they were lowered from 15 to 12 micrograms per cubic meter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The standards were not tightened during the Trump administration. The Trump administration decision prompted an outcry among environmental and public health groups. Then-EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said the US had already “made incredible strides in reducing particulate matter concentrations” and did not need to further increase the standard. But Wheeler’s comments directly contradicted the recommendation of the EPA’s own scientists, which found that further tightening soot regulations could save thousands of lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with the proposed update, the Biden administration is running behind schedule. When Regan initially announced the EPA would consider stricter limits on soot, the agency’s timeline was proposing a draft rule by summer 2022, finalizing the rule in spring of this year.\n",

      "\n",
      "New data helped the agency refine its estimates, however. It now says XBB.1.5 probably accounted for about 18% of new cases that week, jumping to 28% of cases by the end of this week. That’s still fast, but it’s not the week-over-week doubling in spread that had first alarmed variant-watchers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In its weekly review, the CDC explained that its projections are more uncertain when a new variant begins to spread. Its scientists revise their Nowcast estimates for current and previous weeks as new data comes in.\n",

      "Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, says that when he first saw the numbers for XBB.1.5, he was sure it would sweep the country – perhaps the same way the original Omicron had.\n",

      "“Now, it seems more plausible that XBB.1.5 could remain of regional importance, not necessarily of national importance,” Hotez said.\n",

      "\n",
      "XBB.1.5 was first detected in Connecticut and New York and is estimated to be the cause of nearly 60% of all new Covid-19 infections in the Northeast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Covid-19 hospitalizations are also rising in the Northeast, although it’s not clear whether it’s because XBB.1.5 causes more severe disease than some recent subvariants or whether waning immunity is leaving people less protected from Covid-19 infections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hotez suspects that hospitalizations have climbed in step with rising infections.\n",

      "“I would say what it could mean is that because XBB.1.5 is potentially more transmissible, more people are getting infected faster, and therefore that may account for the rise in hospitalizations,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hotez thinks waning immunity may also be playing a role. Update of the new Covid-19 boosters has been low. Although vaccination rates are inching upward, CDC data shows that just 15% of eligible Americans have gotten an updated booster since they were approved in the fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you’ve not gotten that bivalent booster, I don’t think the original vaccinations are going to protect all that well against XBB.1.5,” Hotez said.\n",

      "In a medication abortion, a second drug, misoprostol, is taken within the next 24 to 48 hours. Misoprostol causes the uterus to contract, creating cramping and bleeding. Approved for use in other conditions, such as preventing stomach ulcers, the drug has been available at pharmacies for decades.\n",

      "“While many women obtain medication abortion from a clinic or their OB-GYN, others obtain the pills on their own to self-induce or self-manage their abortion,” said Dr. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Some people do this because they cannot access a clinic — particularly in states with legal restrictions on abortion — or because they have a preference for self-care,” Grossman said. “A growing body of research indicates that self-managed abortion is safe and effective.”\n",

      "CNN: What is the difference between a first-trimester medication abortion and a vacuum aspiration in terms of what a woman experiences?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Daniel Grossman: A vacuum aspiration is most commonly performed under a combination of local anesthetic and oral pain medications or local anesthetic together with intravenous sedation, or what is called conscious sedation.\n",
      "\n",
      "An injection of local anesthetic is given to the area around the cervix, and the cervix is gently dilated or opened up. Once the cervix is opened, a small straw-like tube is inserted into the uterus, and a gentle vacuum is used to remove the pregnancy tissue. Contrary to what some say, if the procedure is done before nine weeks or so, there’s nothing in the tissue that would be recognizable as a part of an embryo.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aspiration procedure takes just a couple of minutes; then the person is observed for one to two hours until any sedation has worn off. We also monitor each patient for very rare complications, such as heavy bleeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grossman: A medication abortion is a more prolonged process. After taking the pills, bleeding and cramping can occur over a period of days. Bleeding is typically heaviest when the actual pregnancy is expelled, but that bleeding usually eases within a few hours. On average people continue to have some mild bleeding for about two weeks or so, which is a bit longer than after a vacuum aspiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, diarrhea and headache can occur after using the abortion pill, and everyone who has a successful medication abortion usually reports some pain.\n",

In the studies that have looked at it, the average maximum level of pain that people report is about a seven to eight out of 10, with 10 being the highest. However, people also say that the pain can be brief, peaking just as the pregnancy is being expelled.\n",
      "\n",
      "The level of cramping and pain can depend on the length of the pregnancy as well as whether or not someone has given birth before. For example, a medical abortion at six weeks or less gestation typically has less pain and cramping than one performed at nine weeks. People who have given birth generally have less pain.\n",

      "CNN: What can be done to help with the pain of a medication abortion?\n",
      "\n",
      "Grossman: There are definitely things that can be used to help with the pain. Research has shown that ibuprofen is better than acetaminophen for treating the pain of medication abortion. We typically advise people to take 600 milligrams every six hours or so as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some people take tramadol, a narcotic analgesic, or Vicodin, which is a combination of acetaminophen and hydrocodone. Recent research I was involved in found medications like tramadol can be helpful if taken prophylactically before the pain starts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another successful regimen that we studied combined ibuprofen with a nausea medicine called metoclopramide that also helped with pain. Other than ibuprofen, these medications require a prescription.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another study found that a TENS device, which stands for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator, helps with the pain of medication abortion. It works through pads put on the abdomen that stimulate the nerves through mild electrical shocks, thus interfering with the pain signals. That’s something people could get without a prescription.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pain can be an overlooked issue with medication abortion because, quite honestly, as clinicians, we’re not there with patients when they are in their homes going through this. But as we’ve been doing more research on people’s experiences with medication abortion, it’s become quite clear that pain control is really important. I think we need to do a better job of treating the pain and making these options available to patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "CNN: Are there health conditions that make the use of a medication abortion unwise?\n",
      "\n",
      "Grossman: Undergoing a medication abortion can be dangerous if the pregnancy is ectopic, meaning the embryo is developing outside of the uterus. It’s rare, happening in about two out of every 100 pregnancies — and it appears to be even rarer among people seeking medication abortion.\n",
      "\n",
      "People who have undergone previous pelvic, fallopian tube or abdominal surgery are at higher risk of an ectopic pregnancy, as are those with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease. Certain sexually transmitted infections can raise risk, as does smoking, a history of infertility and use of infertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n",
      "\n",
      "If a person is on anticoagulant or blood thinning drugs or has a bleeding disorder, a medication abortion is not advised. The long-term use of steroids is another contraindication for using the abortion pill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyone using an intrauterine device, or IUD, must have it removed before taking mifepristone because it may be partially expelled during the process, which can be painful.\n",

      "People with chronic adrenal failure or who have inherited a rare disorder called porphyria are not good candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "CNN: Are there any signs of trouble a woman should watch for after undergoing a medication abortion?\n",
      "\n",
      "Grossman: It can be common to have a low-grade fever in the first few hours after taking misoprostol, the second drug in a medication abortion. If someone has a low-grade fever — 100.4 degrees to 101 degrees Fahrenheit — that lasts more than four hours, or has a high fever of over 101 degrees Fahrenheit after taking the medications, they do need to be evaluated by a health care provider.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heavy bleeding, which would be soaking two or more thick full-size pads an hour for two consecutive hours, or a foul-smelling vaginal discharge should be evaluated as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the warning signs of an ectopic pregnancy is severe pelvic pain, particularly on one side of the abdomen. The pain can also radiate to the back. Another sign is getting dizzy or fainting, which could indicate internal bleeding. These are all very rare complications, but it’s wise to be on the lookout.\n",
      "\n",
      "We usually recommend that someone having a medication abortion have someone with them during the first 24 hours after taking misoprostol or until the pregnancy has passed. Many people specifically choose to have a medication abortion because they can be surrounded by a partner, family or friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most people know that the abortion is complete because they stop feeling pregnant, and symptoms such as nausea and breast tenderness disappear, usually within a week of passing the pregnancy. A home urine pregnancy test may remain positive even four to five weeks after a successful medication abortion, just because it takes that long for the pregnancy hormone to disappear from the bloodstream.\n",
      "\n",
      "If someone still feels pregnant, isn’t sure if the pregnancy fully passed or has a positive pregnancy test five weeks after taking mifepristone, they need to be evaluated by a clinician.\n",

      "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has “done some very preliminary work” to do wastewater testing with airlines, Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer for the National Association of County and City Health Officials, said Wednesday. There have been growing concerns among public health officials to ramp up monitoring for coronavirus variants amid a Covid-19 surge in China.\n",
      "\n",

      "“Honestly, we knew it was increasing.

      "That could be for a few reasons. Kids weigh less than adults, so a drug’s impact can be much more toxic. Additionally, packages usually come with more than one edible in them; adults know to stop after eating just one, but children don’t, the study said.\n",

      "\n",
      "The gold medals are piling up. For the sixth year in a row, the Mediterranean style of eating earned the title of best overall diet, according to 2023 ratings announced Tuesday by U.S. News & World Report. Meals from the sunny Mediterranean also ranked first in the categories of diet best diet for healthy eating and best plant-based diet, the report said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In two new categories added for 2023, the Mediterranean tied with the cholesterol-lowering TLC (Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes) and flexitarian diets as best family-friendly diet, and with DASH (dietary approaches to stop hypertension) for best bone and joint health diet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’re always looking for more health conditions that we can address. But often there’s not enough scientific data examining diet X and condition X,” said Gretel Schueller, managing editor of health for U.S. News & World Report, who oversees the annual diet ranking.\n",
      "\n",
      "“However, bone and joint health is an area where there’s a fair amount of scientific literature,” Schueller said. “We also recognize our population is aging so focusing on diets that can increase the quality of life among older individuals is an important element.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Also new this year: Reviewers only ranked 24 diets instead of the 40 or so diets analyzed in past years. Five diets from the original list — vegetarian, vegan, Nordic, the traditional Asian and the glycemic index — were integrated by judges into the Mediterranean and other diets due to their underlying plant-based principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The take-home message here is the recognition that the Mediterranean diet is really not just about the foods around the Mediterranean,” Schueller said. “You can take the the lessons and the approach of the Mediterranean eating pattern and apply it to any cuisine in any country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That approach is reflected within two new diets — Keyto and Pritikin — that were added to the review for 2023, Schueller said. (Yes. that’s Keyto with a Y.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“We recognize that more and more people are eating sort of a plant-forward or plant-based diet or at least trying to,” she said. “The keto with a Y diet is supposed to be a flexible, low-carb Mediterranean plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Pritikin diet focuses on low-fat, high-fiber eating of whole foods, and is fairly flexible,” she added. “We are seeing a push towards eating more whole, unprocessed foods, which I think is a great thing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "What is a Mediterranean style of eating?\n",
      "\n",
      "Numerous studies have found the Mediterranean diet can reduce the risk for diabetes, high cholesterol, dementia, memory loss, depression and breast cancer. The diet, which is more of an eating style than a restricted diet, has also been linked to stronger bones, a healthier heart and longer life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The diet features simple, plant-based cooking, with the majority of each meal focused on fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans and seeds, with a few nuts and a heavy emphasis on extra-virgin olive oil. Fats other than olive oil, such as butter, are consumed rarely, if at all, and sugar and refined foods are reserved for special occasions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Red meat is used sparingly, usually only to flavor a dish. Eating healthy, oily fish, which are packed with omega-3 fatty acids, is encouraged, while eggs, dairy and poultry are eaten in much smaller portions than in the traditional Western diet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Social interactions during meals and exercise are basic cornerstones of the Mediterranean style of eating. Lifestyle changes that are part of the diet include eating with friends and family, socializing over meals, mindfully eating favorite foods, as well as mindful movement and exercise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second and last place\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as they did in 2022, the DASH and the flexitarian diet tied for second place in best overall diet. Similar to the Mediterranean style of eating, these diets reduce or eliminate processed foods and stress packing your plate with fruits, vegetables, beans, lentils, whole grains, nuts and seeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DASH diet emphasizes limiting salt intake in its goal to reduce blood pressure, while the flexitarian diet, true to its name, allows an occasional indulgence of meat or poultry.\n",
      "\n",
      "A panel of 33 experts examined top diets and ranked them in several categories: Did the diet include all food groups; was it evidence based; are needed foods available at any supermarket; how easy is the diet to prepare, and did it use additional vitamins or supplements.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We focused on quality over quantity,” Schueller said. “Our reviewers felt there are some diets out there that are so wacky they’re not worth giving time to, such as the Dukan diet, which we no longer rank.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The worst diet award went to the raw foods diet this year, at least in part due to the lack of nutritional completeness, which has raised safety concerns among the reviewers. Because followers can only eat unprocessed foods that haven’t been cooked, microwaved, irradiated, genetically engineered or exposed to pesticides or herbicides, reviews consider the diet almost impossible to follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The popular keto diet, along with the modified keto, was ranked 20 out of the 24 diets, followed by Atkins, SlimFast and Optavia. These diets emphasize eating high-protein or high-fat foods with minimal carbohydrates and receive low rankings because they are extremely restrictive, hard to follow and eliminate entire food groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite keto’s low overall rating, reviewers gave the keto diet first place for best short-term weight loss diet, Schueller said, quickly adding that these diets are not considered healthy as a lifestyle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“These are the diets for someone who’s got a wedding or an event they want to go to in the next few months,” she said. “Will you lose weight in the short term? Absolutely. Will you keep it off for the next two years? Probably not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "More winners\n",
      "\n",
      "In the category of best (long-term) weight-loss diet, WW (formely called Weight Watchers) came in first, with DASH and TLC tied for second. WW also got top honors in the best (commercial) diet program, followed by NOOM and Jenny Craig.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flexitarian and TLC shared the gold in the category of easiest diet to follow, while the Mediterranean and DASH diets tied for third.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DASH diet took top honors as best diet for heart health and for people with diabetes, followed by the Mediterranean, flexitarian and Ornish diets. The Ornish diet was created in 1977 by Dr. Dean Ornish, founder of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute in California.\n",
      "\n",

      "In the opening scenes of the new film \"Good Night Oppy,\" the Opportunity rover rolls along through Perseverance Valley on Mars in June 2018, as \"Roam\" by The B-52s fills the room at mission control.\n",
      "\n",
      "The peppy tune was the rover's wake-up song, played at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. In the same way NASA has used a song to wake up astronauts each day they spend in space since the 1960s, the Opportunity rover team began their daily shifts with a song that set the mood for \"Oppy's\" journey.\n",

      "The documentary film \"Good Night Oppy\" follows the Mars Opportunity rover, which turned what NASA expected to be a 90-day mission into 15 years of exploration on the red planet. Credit: Courtesy of Prime Video\n",
      "\n",
      "Oppy had weathered dust storms before, along with solar flares, sand traps, cosmic rays, near collisions and harsh Martian winters for more than a decade while exploring the red planet. In 2018, however, her team was able to recognize the signs of \"gray hairs\" — a failing memory, the desire to nap, arthritis in the robotic arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mission team members still thought of her as their lucky rover, though — invincible. After all, Oppy was designed for a 90-day mission, but she had exceeded all expectations and outlived her twin sister, Spirit, by some seven years.\n",

      "The solar-powered rover's last message to mission control translated to this: \"My battery is low and it's getting dark.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This chapter is just the beginning of the documentary, available to stream on Amazon Prime on November 23. The film traces the journey of the twin rovers and the people who dedicated their lives to them from concept to that last transmission.\n",
      "\n",
      "The film shines a light on the hope of space exploration and captures the emotional attachment between humans and the robotic ambassadors that explore on our behalf.\n",
      "\n",
      "Director Ryan White has woven together decades of footage from the NASA vaults with photorealistic effects and animation from Industrial Light & Magic, the famed visual effects company founded by George Lucas, and narration from actor Angela Bassett. The documentary places the viewer on Mars along with the two rovers as they roam on opposite sides of the red planet.\n",

      "Twin robots\n",
      "\n",
      "As NASA engineers built and tested the twin rovers in the early 2000s, they quickly realized the robots couldn't be more different. Spirit was the headstrong drama queen while Opportunity was the overachiever, according to team members. Spirit was stubborn and struggled through the same tests that Opportunity breezed through. Their personalities seemed as human as their design.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rovers were built to search for past evidence of water on Mars. Both launched in 2003 inside protective shells aboard Delta rockets and landed in 2004 on opposite sides of the red planet. The dual mission's first 90 days came and went, and the JPL team realized the two rovers were ready for more adventure.\n",

      "\n",
      "The bonds between team members and the rovers quickly deepened, despite the vast distance between Earth and Mars — making it all the more difficult when Spirit's journey ended in 2011 and Opportunity fell silent in 2018. There was hope for both rovers to \"wake up\" until the bitter end.\n",

      "The third generation of European spacefarers includes five career astronauts, 11 members of a reserve pool of astronauts and one astronaut with a physical disability, who will take part in a feasibility project to include astronauts with disabilities in human spaceflight and possible future missions. The 17 were chosen from more than 22,500 applicants from across Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This ESA astronaut class is bringing ambition, talent and diversity in many different forms — to drive our endeavours, and our future,” ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher said in a news release, referring to the “continuous exploration in low Earth orbit on the International Space Station, going forward to the Moon — and beyond.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Five new recruits, three men and two women, will start 12 months of basic training at the European Astronaut Centre in Cologne, Germany, to enable them to reach the standard specified by the International Space Station partners, the space agency said. The candidates are Sophie Adenot, Pablo Álvarez Fernández, Rosemary Coogan, Raphaël Liégeois and John McFall.\n",

      "\n",
      "It will reach peak illumination around 6:08 p.m. ET Friday, rising in the east as the sun sets in the US, according to EarthSky.\n",
      "\n",
      "The full moon is considered a micromoon because it appears slightly smaller than normal in our sky and will be at nearly its farthest point from Earth in orbit, about 252,145 miles (405,789 kilometers) away, according to EarthSky. But the moon will still be very bright. A second micromoon is expected in February.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is known as the wolf moon, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac. January was associated with wolves howling outside of villages and being more active in winter, according to the Almanac. The Sioux tribe’s name for January’s full moon means “wolves run together,” according to a guide compiled at Western Washington University.\n",

      "Wintry-sounding names for January’s full moon vary across Native American tribes. The Cheyenne call it the moon of the strong cold, while the Kalapuya know it as atalka, which means “stay inside.” The Haida tribe in Alaska calls it the bear hunting moon, and the Passamaquoddy tribe of the Northeast US knows it as the whirling wind moon.\n",

      "Most years, there are 12 full moons — one for each month. But in 2023, there will be 13 full moons, with two in August.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second full moon in one month is known as a blue moon, like the phrase “once in a blue moon,” according to NASA. Typically, full moons occur every 29 days, while most months in our calendar last 30 or 31 days, so the months and moon phases don’t always align. This results in a blue moon about every 2½ years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two full moons in August can also be considered supermoons, according to EarthSky. Definitions of a supermoon vary, but the term generally denotes a full moon that is brighter and closer to Earth than normal and thus appears larger in the night sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some astronomers say the phenomenon occurs when the moon is within 90% of perigee — its closest approach to Earth in orbit. By that definition, the full moon for July will also be considered a supermoon event, according to EarthSky.\n",
      "\n",

      "A total solar eclipse will occur on April 20, visible to those in Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia and Antarctica. This kind of event occurs when the moon moves between the sun and Earth, blocking out the sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "And for some sky-watchers in Indonesia, parts of Australia and Papua New Guinea, it will be a hybrid solar eclipse. The curvature of Earth’s surface can cause some eclipses to shift between total and annular as the moon’s shadow moves across the globe, according to NASA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like a total solar eclipse, the moon passes between the sun and Earth during an annular eclipse — but it occurs when the moon is at or near its farthest point from Earth, according to NASA. This causes the moon to appear smaller than the sun, so it doesn’t completely block out our star and creates a glowing ring around the moon.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Western Hemisphere-sweeping annular solar eclipse will occur on October 14 and be visible across the Americas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be sure to wear proper eclipse glasses to view solar eclipses safely as the sun’s light can be damaging to the eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, a lunar eclipse can occur only during a full moon when the sun, Earth and moon align and the moon passes into Earth’s shadow. When this occurs, Earth casts two shadows on the moon during the eclipse. The partial outer shadow is called the penumbra; the full, dark shadow is the umbra.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the full moon moves into Earth’s shadow, it darkens, but it won’t disappear. Instead, sunlight passing through Earth’s atmosphere lights the moon in a dramatic fashion, turning it red — which is why the event is often referred to as a “blood moon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Depending on the weather conditions in your area, it may be a rusty or brick-colored red. This happens because blue light undergoes stronger atmospheric scattering, so red light will be the most dominant color highlighted as sunlight passes through the atmosphere and casts it on the moon.\n",
      "\n",

      "A penumbral lunar eclipse will occur on May 5 for those in Africa, Asia and Australia. This less dramatic version of a lunar eclipse happens when the moon moves through the penumbra, or the faint, outer part of Earth’s shadow.\n",
      "\n",
      "A partial lunar eclipse of the hunter’s moon on October 28 will be visible to those in Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, parts of North America and much of South America. Partial eclipses occur when the sun, Earth and moon don’t completely align, so only part of the moon passes into shadow.\n"

      "You may know that being adequately hydrated is important for day-to-day bodily functions such as regulating temperature and maintaining skin health.\n",
      "\n",
      "But drinking enough water is also associated with a significantly lower risk of developing chronic diseases, a lower risk of dying early or lower risk of being biologically older than your chronological age, according to a National Institutes of Health study published Monday in the journal eBioMedicine.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The results suggest that proper hydration may slow down aging and prolong a disease-free life,” said study author Natalia Dmitrieva, a researcher in the Laboratory of Cardiovascular Regenerative Medicine at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, a division of NIH, in a news release.\n",
      "\n",
      "Learning what preventive measures can slow down the aging process is “a major challenge of preventive medicine,” the authors said in the study. That’s because an epidemic of “age-dependent chronic diseases” is emerging as the world’s population rapidly ages. And extending a healthy life span can help improve quality of life and decrease health care costs more than just treating diseases can.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors thought optimal hydration might slow down the aging process, based on previous similar research in mice. In those studies, lifelong water restriction increased the serum sodium of mice by 5 millimoles per liter and shortened their life span by six months, which equals about 15 years of human life, according to the new study. Serum sodium can be measured in the blood and increases when we drink less fluids.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using health data collected over 30 years from 11,255 Black and White adults from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, or ARIC, the research team found adults with serum sodium levels at the higher end of the normal range — which is 135 to 146 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L) — had worse health outcomes than those at the lower end of the range. Data collection began in 1987 when participants were in their 40s or 50s, and the average age of participants at the final assessment during the study period was 76.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adults with levels above 142 mEq/L had a 10% to 15% higher chance of being biologically older than their chronological age compared with participants in the 137 to 142 mEq/L range. The participants with higher faster-aging risk also had a 64% higher risk for developing chronic diseases such as heart failure, stroke, atrial fibrillation, peripheral artery disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes and dementia.\n",
      "\n",
      "And people with levels above 144 mEq/L had a 50% higher risk of being biologically older and a 21% higher risk of dying early. Adults with serum sodium levels between 138 and 140 mEq/L, on the other hand, had the lowest risk of developing chronic disease. The study didn’t have information on how much water participants drank.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This study adds observational evidence that reinforces the potential long-term benefits of improved hydration on reductions in long-term health outcomes, including mortality,” said Dr. Howard Sesso, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and associate epidemiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, via email. Sesso was not involved in the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, “it would have been nice to combine their definition of hydration, based on serum sodium levels only, with actual fluid intake data from the ARIC cohort,” Sesso added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biological age was determined by biomarkers that measure the performance of different organ systems and processes, including cardiovascular, renal (relating to the kidneys), respiratory, metabolic, immune and inflammatory biomarkers.\n",
      "\n",
      "High serum sodium levels weren’t the only factor associated with disease, early death and faster aging risk — risk was also higher among people with low serum sodium levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "This finding is consistent with previous reports of increased mortality and cardiovascular disease in people with low regular sodium levels, which has been attributed to diseases causing electrolyte issues, the authors said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The study analyzed participants over a long period of time, but the findings don’t prove a causal relationship between serum sodium levels and these health outcomes, the authors said. Further studies are needed, they added, but the findings can help doctors identify and guide patients at risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "“People whose serum sodium is 142 mEq/L or higher would benefit from evaluation of their fluid intake,” Dmitrieva said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sesso noted that the study did not strongly address accelerated aging, “which is a complicated concept that we are just starting to understand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Two key reasons underlie this,” Sesso said. The study authors “relied on a combination of 15 measures for accelerated aging, but this is one of many definitions out there for which there is no consensus. Second, their data on hydration and accelerated aging were a ‘snapshot’ in time, so we have no way to understand cause and effect.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Drink enough fluids every day\n",
      "\n",
      "About half of people worldwide don’t meet recommendations for daily total water intake, according to several studies the authors of the new research cited.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the global level, this can have a big impact,” Dmitrieva said in a news release. “Decreased body water content is the most common factor that increases serum sodium, which is why the results suggest that staying well hydrated may slow down the aging process and prevent or delay chronic disease.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Our serum sodium levels are influenced by liquid intake from water, other liquids, and fruits and vegetables with high water content.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The most impressive finding is that this risk (for chronic diseases and aging) is apparent even in individuals who have serum sodium levels that are on the upper end of the ‘normal range,’” said Dr. Richard Johnson, professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, via email. He was not involved in the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This challenges the question of what is really normal, and supports the concept that as a population we are probably not drinking enough water.”\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 50% of your body is made of water, which is also needed for multiple functions, including digesting food, creating hormones and neurotransmitters, and delivering oxygen throughout your body, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The National Academy of Medicine (formerly known as the Institute of Medicine) recommends women consume 2.7 liters (91 ounces) of fluids daily, and that men have 3.7 liters (125 ounces) daily. This recommendation includes all fluids and water-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables and soups. Since the average water intake ratio of fluids to foods is around 80:20, that amounts to a daily amount of 9 cups for women and 12 ½ cups for men.\n",
      "\n",
      "People with health conditions should talk with their doctor about how much fluid intake is right for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The goal is to ensure patients are taking in enough fluids, while assessing factors, like medications, that may lead to fluid loss,” said study coauthor Dr. Manfred Boehm, director of the Laboratory of Cardiovascular Regenerative Medicine, in a news release. “Doctors may also need to defer to a patient’s current treatment plan, such as limiting fluid intake for heart failure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re having trouble staying hydrated, you might need help working the habit into your usual routine. Try leaving a glass of water at your bedside to drink when you wake up, or drink water while your morning coffee is brewing. Anchor your hydration habit to a location you’re in a few times per day, behavioral science expert Dr. B.J. Fogg, founder and director of the Stanford University Behavior Design Lab, previously told CNN.\n"

      "\n",
      "1. Exercise regularly\n",
      "\n",
      "Years ago a doctor told me, “If there’s one thing in life you can do to live a longer, healthier life, it’s exercise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“People who are physically active for about 150 minutes a week have a 33% lower risk of all-cause mortality than those who are physically inactive,” our nation’s top health organization says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s just say that again in people-speak: If you get up and move for 21.43 minutes each day of the week, you cut your risk of dying from anything by one-third.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some benefits are immediate: After finishing one 30-minute physical activity you’ll have less anxiety, lower blood pressure, more sensitivity to insulin and you’ll sleep better that night.\n",

      "Get moving: Regular physical activity reduces your risk of death, the CDC says. Chris Joubert/StratfordProductions/Adobe Stock\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Within a few months, you’ll see improvement in your blood pressure, heart and lung functions as well as a lowering of risk for depression, anxiety, type 2 diabetes and bladder, breast, colon, kidney, lung and stomach cancers, according to the CDC. Not to mention exercise can offer the benefits of stress reduction, better sleep and a more robust sex life.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you need some ideas on how to get started, sign up for CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series. The seven-part guide will help you ease into a healthy, expert-backed workout routine.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Eat a plant-based diet\n",
      "\n",
      "Keeping a healthy weight – defined by doctors as having a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 24.9 – is another key way to stay healthy and reduce your risk of all manner of diseases and conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The largest gains in longevity were found from eating more legumes, which include beans, peas and lentils; whole grains, which are the entire seed of a plant; and nuts such as walnuts, almonds, pecans and pistachios, according to the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are lots of excellent diets out there to help you lose and keep your weight under control, such as the DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension), which helps with hypertension, the MIND diet (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay), which focuses on food to slow cognitive decline, and the Flexitarian Diet, which combines the words flexible and vegetarian.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the gold medal goes to the Mediterranean Diet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Science has shown meals from the sunny Mediterranean can reduce the risk for diabetes, high cholesterol, stroke, dementia, memory loss, depression and breast cancer. The plan has also been linked to stronger bones, a healthier heart and microbiome and longer life. Oh, and weight loss, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "It shares a key element with the rest of the diets mentioned above: It’s plant-based, meaning you’ll eat a lot of fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts and seeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "You’ll also eat less red meat, sugar and saturated fat and more omega-3-rich fish (twice a week) and olive oil. Think of chicken, beef and pork as a “seasoning” to a dish, instead of the main course. (It’s better for the planet, too.)\n",

      "\n",
      "And here’s the real secret to the success of the Mediterranean Diet – it’s not dieting at all. It’s a lifestyle, with the greatest emphasis placed on exercise, mindfully eating with friends and family and socializing over meals.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for exercise, it doesn’t have to be in a gym.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Mediterranean lifestyle is walking with friends and family,” said registered dietitian Kelly Toups in a prior interview. “Instead of thinking of exercise as something that you have to do, just walk or dance or move in joyful ways.”\n",

      "\n",
      "3. Get good-quality sleep\n",
      "\n",
      "You may choose to exercise or eat healthy, but your body is going to demand sleep. The quantity and quality of it, however, is under your control.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depending on your age, you are supposed to get between seven and 10 hours of sleep each night. Getting less has been linked in studies to high blood pressure, a weakened immune system, weight gain, a lack of libido, mood swings, paranoia, depression and a higher risk of diabetes, stroke, cardiovascular disease, dementia and some cancers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not convinced? Sleeping less than the recommended amount each night on a regular basis may double your risk of dying. In a longitudinal study of 10,308 British civil servants, researchers found that those who reduced their sleep from seven to five hours or fewer a night were almost twice as likely to die from all causes, especially cardiovascular disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and as you head toward death, your chances of developing a major disease or medical condition skyrocket if you don’t get enough sleep. That’s because during sleep, your body is literally repairing and restoring itself on a cellular level.\n",

      "Title:  5 tips for a 'dry January' any time of the year\n",
      "News:  CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "There are lots of great reasons to decide to go “dry” in January and give up alcohol. Perhaps you imbibed a bit too much over the holidays or want to start a diet or exercise routine and can’t afford the calories or the zap in energy and motivation that drinking can bring.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Or it may be someone who truly is starting to wonder or question their relationship with alcohol, and this is an opportunity to really explore that,” said Dr. Sarah Wakeman, medical director of the Substance Use Disorders Initiative at Massachusetts General Hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For some people saying, ‘I’m not going to drink this entire month,’ might be really hard, so trying to do so may show you how easy or difficult it is for you,” said neuropsychologist Dr. Sanam Hafeez, who conducts classes at Columbia University’s Teachers College.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the advice from experts on how to have a successful “dry January”? Read on.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Know your reasons\n",
      "\n",
      "It helps to be clear about your goal to make it a habit, said Wakeman, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The research we have on goal setting says goals are more likely to be achieved if they’re really relevant to you as an individual and not abstract like ‘I should stop drinking because drinking is bad,’ ” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Concrete goals such as embracing new sleep habits or an exercise routine will help make giving up drinking easier, she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I really want to stop drinking because I know when I drink heavily I don’t get up the next morning and I don’t work out is a very specific goal,” Wakeman said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional motivation can come from the health gains you can make from reducing or eliminating alcohol, experts say.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Drinking less over time can have really measurable benefits in your health in terms of your blood pressure, your risk of cancer, your risk of liver disease and other conditions,” Wakeman said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Over the course of a month, you may notice some short-term benefits like better sleep, a better complexion due to improvements in your skin, feeling more clearheaded and having more energy,” she added.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Set SMART goals\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of us may be familiar with SMART goals from work or school settings. They are used to help people set attainable goals. The acronym stands for:\n",
      "\n",
      "Specific: Set an achievable goal, such as cutting back on drinking three days a week. You can add days until you reach your final goal. Measurable: How many drinks will you cut — and what are the drink sizes? A beer is 12 ounces, a glass of wine is 5 ounces and a serving of spirits is 1.5 ounces. Achievable: Make sure there are not a bunch of social engagements where alcohol is likely to be served during your month of abstention. Relevant: How is not drinking going to help me with my life and health? Time based: Set a reasonable time frame to finish your efforts. If you like, you can set another goal later.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you set a bar too high, you may fail, so it’s better to set smaller goals to achieve it,” Hafeez said. “Nothing starts without an honest conversation with yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Share your goal with others\n",
      "\n",
      "Informing a few friends or family members of your goal can help you reach it, experts say. For some people it may work to announce their plan on social media — and invite others to join in and report back on their progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s where I think ‘dry January’ has kind of caught on,” Wakeman said. “If you publicly state you’re going to do something, you’re more likely to stick with it than if you keep it to yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Consider a mocktail\n",
      "\n",
      "Drinking is often associated with social gatherings or fun times. That can train your brain to see alcohol as a positive. You can combat those urges by replacing your drink of choice with something equally festive or flavorful, experts say.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For some people it can be just sparkling water, and for other people it’s actually having a mocktail or some sort of (nonalcoholic) drink that feels fun and celebratory,” Wakeman said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Substituting one behavior for another can work because you’re tricking your brain,” Hafeez said. “That can absolutely help you avoid temptation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "An entire industry is devoted to making nonalcoholic drinks that taste (at least a bit) like the real thing. Some even claim to have added ingredients that are “calming” or “healthy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m skeptical of anything that claims to relax you or have amazing health benefits that comes in a glass regardless of what it is,” Wakeman said. “But if it’s an alternative that allows you to feel like you’re not missing out on a social situation and helps you make the changes that you want to your alcohol consumption, I don’t think there’s any downside to that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Track your progress, goal and feelings\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if you don’t end up cutting out all alcohol, tracking your emotions and urges to discover your triggers can be helpful, Wakeman said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Even just measuring your behavior, whether it’s alcohol or exercise or your diet, can be an intervention in and of itself,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Even if someone’s not yet ready to make changes, just keeping a diary of when you’re drinking, what situations you’re drinking more and how you’re feeling at those times, can really help you identify sort of trigger situations where you may be more likely to drink,” Wakeman added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monitor your symptoms\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s an additional piece that’s important in accomplishing a “dry January,” experts say. It’s important to notice if you — or a loved one — are showing any negative symptoms from cutting back or eliminating alcohol. It could be a sign that you need professional help to reach your goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The first thing to be mindful of is whether or not you actually have an alcohol use disorder,” Wakeman said. “If someone’s been drinking very heavily every single day and is at risk for withdrawal symptoms, then it can actually be dangerous to stop abruptly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A person with an alcohol use disorder, who has gotten used to having a certain level of alcohol in their body every day, can go into withdrawal and experience severe physical symptoms such as shakiness, sweating, rapid heart rate and seizures.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That would be a real indication that you need to talk to a medical professional about getting medical treatment for withdrawal and not stopping on your own,” Wakeman said.\n"

      "Some people love the tradition of setting a goal each January 1. Others argue it’s a waste of time since most resolutions fail by mid-March. But there is actually a logic to jumping on the New Year’s resolution bandwagon, despite the grim numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "My collaborators and I have shown that on new beginnings — dates like New Year’s Day, your birthday and even Mondays — you’re extra motivated to tackle your goals because you feel like you can turn the page on past failures. Maybe you meant to quit smoking, get fit or start going to bed at a reasonable hour last year and didn’t. A fresh start like New Year’s lets you relegate those missteps to a past chapter and tell yourself, “That was the old me, but the new me will be different.”\n",

      "\n",
      "If your New Year’s resolution is to meditate five days each week, a plan like “I’ll meditate on weekdays” would be too vague. But a cue-based plan like “I’ll meditate at the office on weekdays during my lunch break” would fit the bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plotting when and where you’ll execute on your resolution jogs your memory when it’s opportune and generates guilt if you flake out.

      "\n",
      "This may sound sinister, but ensuring you’ll face some penalty if you don’t achieve your New Year’s resolution can work wonders.\n",
      "\n",
      "One easy way to do this is by telling a few people about your goal so you’ll feel ashamed if they check back later and find out you haven’t followed through. (Telling all your social media followers would up the ante further).\n",
      "\n",
      "A steeper penalty than shame, however, is putting cold hard cash on the table, and there is excellent evidence that self-imposed cash penalties motivate success. You can make a bet with a friend that you’ll stick to your New Year’s resolution or pay. Alternatively, technology can help. Websites like StickK.com and Beeminder.com invite you to put money on the line that you’ll have to forfeit to a charity if you don’t achieve a stated goal. You just have to name a referee and set the stakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The logic for why this works is simple. Incentives change our decisions, and penalties are even more motivating than rewards. We’re used to being fined for our missteps by outsiders (governments, health plans, neighborhood associations) but this time you’re fining yourself for misbehavior.\n",

      "\n",
      "Most of us strive for efficiency when it comes to achieving our goals. If you want to get fit, you figure a punishing workout will be just the thing to produce rapid progress. If you want to ace a class, you assume long, distraction-free study sessions are key. But research has shown that focusing on efficiency can leave you high and dry because you’ll neglect an even more important part of the equation: whether you enjoy the act of goal pursuit.\n",

      "\n",
      "If it’s not fun to exercise or study, you’re unlikely to keep at it. But if you get pleasure from your workouts or study sessions, research has found you’ll persist longer. And in the end, that’s what often matters most to achieving a resolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "One way to make pursuing a goal that normally feels like a chore more fun is to combine it with a guilty pleasure. I call this “temptation bundling.” Consider only letting yourself watch your favorite TV show at the gym so you’ll start looking forward to workouts. Or only letting yourself drink a mocha latte during study sessions so there is a hook to get you to the library. My own research shows that temptation bundling can come in handy when you might otherwise abandon your New Year’s resolution.\n",

      "\n",
      "If you deviate at all from your New Year’s resolution, your instinct may be to declare yourself a failure and throw in the towel. Researchers call this the “What the hell effect.” Here’s what it looks like: You planned to get to bed early every night but couldn’t resist staying up late one Friday to watch an extra episode of “Succession.” After that, your early-to-bed plans went out the window because “What the hell,” you’d already failed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Happily, there is a way to dodge this fate. By setting tough goals (like a 10 p.m. bedtime every night) but giving yourself one or two get-out-of-jail-free cards each week, you can get better results than by setting either tough or easy goals without wiggle room, research has revealed. Your stretch goal keeps you motivated, and the ability to declare an “emergency” (rather than saying “what the hell”) keeps you pushing forward after a misstep.\n",

      "\n",
      "Why not get a little help from your friends?\n",
      "\n",
      "Spending time around high achievers can boost your own performance. If your New Year’s resolution is to run a marathon or write a book, you’d be wise to start hanging around friends who’ve made it to the finish line (literally or figuratively) and can show you how it’s done. You’ll pick up a bit just by spending time together because you’ll be inclined to conform to their patterns of behavior. But my research and studies done by others show that if you explicitly ask successful friends how they achieved a shared goal and try out those tactics yourself, you’ll gain even more ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strangely enough, there is evidence that coaching friends with shared goals can improve your success rate, too. When you’re on the hook to give someone else tips on how to achieve, it boosts your self-confidence (why would they listen to you if you didn’t have something to offer?). It also forces you to be introspective about what works in ways you might not otherwise. And of course, you’ll feel hypocritical if you don’t follow your own words of wisdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Happily, pursuing your New Year’s resolutions with friends is also more fun, and that’s another key to success.\n",

      "\n",
      "Let’s say New Year’s Day has passed by the time you’re reading this article, and you feel you’ve already failed. The science says you have not. You can start over on any fresh start you choose – next Monday, next month or on your birthday. Or pick any day to start over, and follow these five steps to establishing another good habit.\n"

      "CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you celebrating the first day of 2023 with a hangover?\n",
      "\n",
      "If so, you might be looking for a method to ease your misery. There are certainly a lot of so-called hangover cures, some dating back centuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The ancient Greeks believed that eating cabbage could cure a hangover, and the Romans thought that a meal of fried canaries would do the trick,” said Dr. John Brick, former chief of research at the Center of Alcohol Studies, Education and Training Division at Rutgers University in New Jersey, who authored “The Doctor’s Hangover Handbook.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Today, some Germans believe that a hearty breakfast of red meat and bananas cures hangovers. You might find some French drinking strong coffee with salt, or some Chinese drinking spinach tea,” he said. “Some of the more unusual hangover cures are used by some people in Puerto Rico, who rub half a lemon under their drinking arm.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In truth, the only cure for a hangover is time, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A person must wait for the body to finish clearing the toxic byproducts of alcohol metabolism, to rehydrate, to heal irritated tissue, and to restore immune and brain activity to normal,” according to the institute. That recovery process can take up to 24 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are there things you can do to ease your transition? Possibly, experts say, but many common hangover “cures” may make your hangover worse. Here’s how to separate fact from fiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Myth: Drinking a bit more helps\n",
      "\n",
      "Having another drink, or the “hair of the dog that bit you,” is a well-known cure for a hangover, right? Not really, experts say.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason some people believe it works is because once the calming effects of alcohol pass, the brain on a hangover is overstimulated. (It’s also the reason you wake up in the middle of the night once your body has metabolized alcohol.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ve got this hyperexcitability in the brain after the alcohol is gone,” said Dr. Robert Swift, a professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University’s Warren Alpert Medical School in Providence, Rhode Island.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you look at the brain of somebody with a hangover, even though the person might feel tired, their brain is actually overexcited,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consuming more alcohol normalizes the brain again, “because you’re adding a sedative to your excited brain,” Swift said. “You feel better until the alcohol goes away and the cycle repeats in a way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fact: Drinking coffee can speed up recovery\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is yes, depending on hangover symptoms, Brick said. If you’re a coffee drinker, skipping your morning cup of joe may lead to caffeine withdrawal on top of your hangover.\n",
      "\n",
      "But coffee can irritate the stomach lining, which is already inflamed by alcohol, Brick said. So if you are queasy and nauseous, coffee may only make matters worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you have a hangover, have a quarter of a cup of coffee,” Brick suggested. “See if you feel better — it takes about 20 minutes for the caffeine to start to have some noticeable effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If coffee doesn’t make you feel better, don’t drink anymore. Obviously, that’s not the cure for your hangover.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Myth: Eating greasy food helps\n",
      "\n",
      "Forget eating a greasy breakfast in the wee hours after a night of drinking — you’re adding insult to injury, Swift said: “Greasy food is harder to digest, so it’s probably good to avoid it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Eating greasy food also doesn’t make much sense. The alcohol we drink, called ethyl alcohol or ethanol, is the byproduct of fermenting carbohydrates and starches, usually some sort of grain, grape or berry. While it may create some tasty beverages, ethanol is also a solvent, Brick said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It cuts through grease in your stomach much the same way it cleans grease off oily car parts,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, experts suggest using food to prevent hangovers, by eating before you have that first drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eating food loaded with protein and carbohydrates can significantly slow down the absorption of alcohol,” Brick said. “The slower the alcohol gets to your brain, the less rapid the ‘shock’ to your brain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fact: Electrolytes help\n",
      "\n",
      "Alcohol dehydrates, so a headache and other hangover symptoms may be partly due to constricted blood vessels and a loss of electrolytes, essential minerals such as sodium, calcium and potassium that your body needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’ve vomited, you’ve lost even more electrolytes, and all of this can lead to fatigue, confusion, irregular heart rate, digestive problems and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Replacing lost fluids with water or a type of sports drink with extra electrolytes can help boost recovery from a hangover, Swift said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Myth: Taking acetaminophen before bed can prevent a hangover\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking over-the-counter pain meds can be dangerous, especially if you take too many while intoxicated, experts say. Taking an acetaminophen, such as Tylenol, can further damage your overtaxed liver, while aspirin and ibuprofen can irritate your stomach lining.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You should never, never take alcohol with acetaminophen or Tylenol,” Swift said. “You can actually cause liver damage from an overdose of Tylenol.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen are “theoretically” OK, he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Even though they tend to be anti-inflammatory in the body, they can cause inflammation in the stomach,” Swift said. “Don’t take them on an empty stomach; always take anti-inflammatories with food.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fact: Drink as much water as you can\n",
      "\n",
      "While most alcohol is handled by the liver, a small amount leaves the body unchanged through sweat, urine and breathing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Get up, do some light stretching and walking, and drink plenty of water to encourage urination, Brick said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Before you go to sleep and when you wake up, drink as much water as you comfortably can handle,” he said. You can also take a multivitamin “before you hit the shower in the morning (to) replenish lost vitamins, minerals and other nutrients.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Drink as much water as you can when you wake up the next day. A multivitamin also may help. Maskot/Getty Images\n",
      "\n",
      "If you would rather have something warm and soothing, Brick suggested broth or other homemade soups.\n",
      "\n",
      "“These will also help to replace lost salts, including potassium and other substances,” he said, “but will not make you sober up faster or improve impairment due to intoxication or hangover.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Myth: Hangover pills can help\n",
      "\n",
      "Store shelves are packed with so-called hangover cures. Unfortunately, there’s no proof they work. In 2020, researchers published what they called the “world’s largest randomised double-blind placebo-controlled” trial of supplements containing vitamins, minerals, plant extracts and antioxidants and found no real improvement in hangover symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if one solution works, it likely won’t fix all your symptoms, experts say.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The effects of alcohol and alcoholic beverages are so complicated, so complex,” Swift said, “that any solution might address one or two of the symptoms but won’t address them all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "What does work for a hangover? Time. It will take time for your body to release all the toxins causing your misery, experts say. And the only way to prevent a hangover is to abstain.\n",
      "URL:  http://cnn.com/2022/12/30/health/hangover-prevention-wellness\n",
      "Title:  How to beat that New Year’s hangover before it starts\n",
      "News:  CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "Toasting the birth of the new year is an age-old ritual, and for many, so is that dreaded morning aftermath — a hangover.\n",
      "\n",
      "What seemed like great fun at the time is now causing your hands to shake, your head to pound and your heart to race, not to mention other unpleasant symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity and excruciating thirst.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why are you suffering? Because the liquor that smoothly passed your lips is now wreaking havoc in your body, causing dehydration, stomach distress and inflammation. These ailments peak about the time all the alcohol leaves your body.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no scientifically proven way to cure a hangover, but experts say you can prevent one — or at least keep that morning-after misery to a minimum. Here’s how.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drink on a full stomach\n",
      "\n",
      "Forget a late-night meal after a night of drinking — that’s much too late, experts say. Instead, eat before your first drink and keep noshing as the night goes on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Food in the stomach slows gastric emptying and can reduce hangover symptoms,” said Dr. Robert Swift, a professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University’s Warren Alpert Medical School in Providence, Rhode Island.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eating a little before you start drinking can reduce your hangover symptoms, experts say. MaximFesenko/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n",
      "\n",
      "Why does food help? Because most alcohol isn’t absorbed by an empty stomach but via the intestinal tract just below it, Swift said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If somebody does shots on an empty stomach, for example, all that pure alcohol is not diluted by the stomach and is passed to the intestine very quickly,” said Swift, who has studied alcohol abuse since the 1990s.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If the stomach contains food, however, there are gastric juices and enzymes that mix the food and the alcohol, and only small amounts of food are passed into the intestine,” he said. “Now the alcohol is diluted in the stomach, and only a small quantity of alcohol is absorbed at any time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Stay hydrated\n",
      "\n",
      "The same principle applies to water and other nonalcoholic beverages, Swift said. “If alcohol is mixed with fluid, it’s diluted, so when it goes into your intestines, it’s not as irritating. You’re less likely to have inflamed intestines or an inflamed stomach lining.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Drinking water can help reduce the dehydration that occurs from downing too many alcoholic drinks. Lightfield Studios/Adobe Stock\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s another benefit to downing water between drinks, said Dr. John Brick, former chief of research at the Center of Alcohol Studies, Education and Training Division at Rutgers University in New Jersey.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The primary cause of hangovers is dehydration and the loss of fluids, along with vitamins and minerals,” said Brick, who authored “The Doctor’s Hangover Handbook” and published scientific papers on the biobehavioral effects of alcohol and other drugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Downing just 3½ alcoholic drinks can result in the loss of up to a quart of water over several hours, Brick added. “That’s a good amount of water that has to be replenished.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dehydration from alcohol may affect a woman even more, and she is more likely to suffer a hangover, even if she drinks less than a man, Swift said. That’s because a man has a higher percentage of body water than a woman of the same height and weight, so the same amount of alcohol will be more diluted in a man, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The woman will have a higher concentration of blood alcohol because her body contains less water to dilute it,” he said. “Women are much more susceptible to the deleterious effects of alcohol (and they) get more intoxicated and develop alcohol liver disease sooner in life than men do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Pick beer, wine or spirits with fewer additives\n",
      "\n",
      "The alcohol we drink, called ethyl alcohol or ethanol, is the byproduct of fermenting carbohydrates and starches, usually some sort of grain, grape or berry. We use byproducts of fermentation in other ways: Ethanol is added to the gasoline in our cars, and methyl alcohol or methanol — a toxic substance — is used as a solvent, pesticide and alternative fuel source. Also called wood alcohol, methyl alcohol made by bootleggers blinded or killed thousands of people during Prohibition.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s not all — the list of byproducts or chemicals added by manufacturers for flavor and taste can read like a list of supplies at an industrial warehouse: ethyl formate, ethyl acetate, n-propanol, isobutanol, n-butanol, isopentanol and isoamyl alcohols. While these congeners, as they are called, are added in small, nontoxic amounts, some people are overly sensitive to their effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, dark-colored beer and spirits tend to contain more congeners and thus may be more likely to cause hangovers, experts say. A 2010 study investigated the intensity of hangovers in people who drank the darker-colored liquor bourbon versus clear vodka.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Congeners in bourbon … significantly increased hangover intensity, which is not too surprising since bourbon has about 37 times the amount of congeners as vodka,” Brick said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chemical preservatives called sulfites, known to cause allergic reactions in sensitive people, are also a natural byproduct of fermentation in small quantities. However, many manufacturers of beer and wine add sulfites to their products to extend shelf life. (Sulfites are also added to soda, cereals, sweeteners, canned and ultra-processed foods, medications and more.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Sweet and white wines tend to have more sulfites than red, but red wines contain more tannins, which are bitter or astringent compounds found in the skin and seeds of grapes. Like sulfites, tannins can trigger allergic reactions in people who are sensitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, limiting your drinking to light beers, clear liquors and white wine might help keep hangovers at bay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abstain\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, however, experts say there is only one true preventive — or cure — for a hangover: Don’t drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s no simple cure because there are so many complex factors that are producing the multiple symptoms of a hangover,” Swift said. “And that’s why the only real cure for a hangover is to not drink alcohol or drink such a low amount of alcohol that it won’t trigger a hangover.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the process through which alcohol is absorbed in the body.\n"

      "The cheap price tag of the Extreme Croquettes flies in the face of the quality of the ingredients. They're made fresh daily with no preservatives. Ingredients include three-year-old female A5-ranked Kobe beef and potatoes sourced from a local ranch.\n",

      "\"At that time, we raised the price to JPY500 ($3.4)-JPY540 ($3.7) with consumption tax. But since the export of Kobe beef began, the prices of beef have doubled, so the fact that the production of croquettes makes a deficit has not changed,\" says Nitta.\n",

      "Production has also been boosted from 200 croquettes a week to 200 croquettes per day.\n",

      "\n",
      "What's more likely though is that the project was shelved due to the enormous technical challenges, as well as certain financial interests in Corinth, a strategically located city that rose to become one of antiquity's most eminent commercial and political centers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much of the wealth of Corinth is believed to have come from the high duties paid by merchants in order to gain access to \"Diolkos,\" a stone-paved road that allowed vessels -- greased with animal fat and mounted on wheeled carriages -- to be dragged overland from the Gulf of Corinth to the Saronic Gulf, thus avoiding the circumnavigation of the Peloponnese.\n",

      "Vestiges of the famous trackway can still be seen on the isthmus today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interest in a navigable canal was revived some 300 years later by Demetrius I Poliorcetes (known as \"the Besieger\") but it's claimed that he backed out after engineers erroneously advised him that creating a watercourse would risk flooding the islands in the Saronic Gulf due to its surface standing lower than the Gulf of Corinth.\n",

      "Overall, some 2,500 people worked on the construction of the project, using cutting-edge machinery imported mainly from France.\n",

      "In the decades that followed, the Corinth Canal became a major hub with a \"priceless\" navigational value for vessels heading from the Adriatic Sea, the Ionian and the western Mediterranean to ports in the Black Sea and eastern Mediterranean, and vice versa, Zouglis said.\n",

      "\n",
      "A massive 60,000 cubic meters of soil cascaded into the canal as a result, shutting it down for five years.\n",
      "\n",
      "While it remains an important navigational route, the canal's width at sea level is 24.6 meters and at its bottom 21.3 meters, making many vessels today too wide to cross it, while the two striking vertical slabs of rock framing it reach up to 79 meters above sea level.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2019, 22.5 meter wide cruise liner Braemars squeezed through the tidal waterway, becoming the longest boat to make the journey , according to cruise company Fred Olsen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, the canal was shut again in 2021, this time due to landslides, and a €32 million ($32 million) restoration project was put in place.\n",
      "\n",
      "While it reopened to shipping after 18 months, Greek authorities announced in October that the canal would closing until the following summer for the second phase of restoration works.\n",

      "Officials are now aiming to improve tourism infrastructure around the structure in order to attract further interest in the region.\n",

      "(CNN) — Some people say flying just isn't glamorous enough. And as airlines battle to cast themselves as the sleekest team in the skies, another brand has heard that complaint.\n",
      "\n",
      "British Airways has unveiled a new uniform -- its first in nearly two decades. The airline's current threads, designed by Julien MacDonald, will be replaced by a line created by Ozwald Boateng, the Savile Row designer and tailor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Engineers and ground operations staff will get their new uniforms in Spring 2023, while onboard crew and check-in agents will receive theirs in the summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new clothing range includes jumpsuits. British Airways\n",
      "\n",
      "And to keep things relatively green -- at least, for an airline -- staff will hand in their old uniform for recycling or charity donation when they pick up the new. Around 90% of the material is a fabric mix using recycled polyester.\n",
      "\n",
      "The path to new uniforms has been a lengthy one, starting in 2018 and involving over 1,500 staff, who took part in design workshops and garment trials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Boateng shadowed staff to get an idea of their movements and requirements before designing the line, while for the past six months, crew have worn the uniform in \"secret trials\" on cargo flights, while maintenance staff have worn them out of sight at the UK's Manchester and Cotswold Airports, according to a press release.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those trials have actually produced changes, too -- engineers requested (and got) easy-access tool pockets, while ground handlers asked for gloves with fabric that would enable them to use their devices while wearing them. Crew had their apron pockets widened after reporting in trials that they needed more space during meal service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Related content This Italian airline just got a sassy new look\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the uniforms themselves, the airline says the Boateng has created \"bespoke fabrics and designs.\" An \"airwave\" pattern, inspired by air flowing across an airplane wing, features on jackets, t-shirts, buttons and ties, while a jacquard fabric used for tailored items incorporates the \"speedmarque\" -- BA's logo-like 'swish' painted on planes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Boateng worked for four years on the uniforms. British Airways\n",
      "\n",
      "The collection has a tailored three-piece suit for men, who can choose between regular or slim fit pants. Women can choose between pants, skirt, dress or -- a first for an airline -- a jumpsuit. There is also a tunic and hijab option. Of course, the uniforms aren't quite up to Savile Row specifications -- they are \"high-quality, resilient fabrics that are easy to care for.\" The outdoor uniforms have even been put into freezers and into the shower to test their fit for extreme weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "Boateng said in a statement: \"Designing this uniform was a vast and painstaking undertaking and it went far beyond clothes. It was about creating an energetic shift internally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over 1,500 members of staff helped trial the uniforms. British Airways\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One of my main objectives was to create something that spoke to, and for, the airline's colleagues. Something that inspired and empowered them, encouraged them to conduct their roles with pride and most importantly to ensure that they felt seen and heard. Although the airline has a strong heritage, it was imperative to support in creating a fresh narrative of change and transcendence, while remaining timeliness.\"\n",

      "A former 14th-century monastery with unique views of the Etna volcano and coastline, the hotel is as much a star of the show as its cast of Hollywood and Italian A-listers. And, says its real-life manager, Lorenzo Maraviglia, it's a match for its fictional counterpart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The resort's real vibe is very much similar to what you see and feel in the series,\" he tells CNN Travel. \"It's vibrant, it's about Sicily -- both romantic and sexy --and about our incredible guests who this year included Madonna and Sharon Stone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Made for HBO (which, like CNN, is part of Warner Bros. Discovery), the series is filmed around Taormina, Noto, Cefalù and Palermo, but the San Domenico Palace is at the heart of the intrigue and steamy liaisons that develop over the course of the seven-episode season.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"We may notice if there are weird movements if a situation becomes obvious, but Taormina and our resort are places where such things usually don't happen. It's for families and couples on their honeymoon. Even if someone may have a weekend adventure, it is not perceivable by us.\"\n",

      "Title:  They met on a European sleeper train. They've been married for nearly 30 years\n",
      "News:  (CNN) — Katy Vernon and Randy Vanderwood first spotted one another on a crowded station platform. It was the summer of 1991. The two strangers were waiting to board a sleeper train from Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, to the newly unified Berlin in Germany.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Randy's bright blue coat, with its contrasting neon green lapels, that first caught Katy's eye amid the crowds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she noticed Randy's neatly combed hair. This clean cut, brightly-dressed man looked different from anyone Katy knew back home in London.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was in drama school at the time, so everyone I knew was very scruffy,\" Katy tells CNN Travel today. \"I just remember thinking, 'He looks very clean and American.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Randy's first impressions of Katy were less favorable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I noticed her and her friends leaned over on this curb, smoking cigarettes, and I wasn't very impressed,\" Randy tells CNN Travel today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Katy was right, Randy was an American. And his clean cut appearance was partially explained by his job -- he was serving in the US Air Force. At the time, Randy was stationed in England and was spending his summer leave traveling across Europe with his brother, who was visiting from the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Katy, she was British and in the middle of a drama degree in London. When three of her girlfriends had proposed the summer rail trip across Europe, Katy had jumped at the chance. Two years prior, her father had passed away, and her mother died when Katy was 12. In the summer of 1991, 19-year-old Katy was still processing going through so much loss at such a young age.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was very emotionally just kind of unstable in many ways,\" says Katy. \"I decided, 'I'm going to just have fun, not thinking about boys, and just have a girls getaway.' So that was how I went into this experience.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Amsterdam to Berlin train was late, and as time went on, more and more people filled up the platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the train eventually arrived, passengers poured on. It was quickly clear there were way more travelers than there were seats. Katy and her three friends had reserved a sleeper cabin, but another group had already taken it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Randy and Katy saw one another again, Katy was in the middle of trying to persuade the other passengers to give up the cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Randy thought Katy and her friends were being a bit \"obnoxious and loud\" about what seemed like a misunderstanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, Katy agrees they were \"very loud,\" but counters that they had their reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We were advocating for ourselves as young women to travel safely and get the seats we had paid for,\" she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Randy's brother started chatting to Katy and her friends as they fought their case. While this was all going down, Randy spotted a spare seat in the cabin next door, so he nabbed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, Katy and her friends successfully hunkered down in their reclaimed compartment, where Randy's brother joined them.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the train made its way east, Katy, her three friends and Randy's brother chatted into the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"His brother told us about himself, he was at university at the time. He mentioned they were there because Randy was in the military,\" recalls Katy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Really, my only takeaway was that I thought it was hilarious that someone was called Randy, and that it wasn't short for anything. It was just his name. Being a young British person, I just thought that was quite funny.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the course of the conversation, it became clear Randy and his brother were winging their trip, deciding on the day what to see and where to go next. Meanwhile, Katy's group \"had a very definite itinerary.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When morning broke, and the train arrived in Berlin, Randy peaked his head out of his cabin. Randy's brother explained they were going to spend the day in Berlin with the British girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was then that Randy introduced himself to Katy properly. And in doing so, he revoked his initial negative impression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They were very nice to say, 'Hey, just hang out with us if you guys want,'\" he says today. \"That's when I really actually got to know them, because we basically followed them around Berlin, from museum to museum.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Katy and her friends planned to spend two days in Berlin, and then travel on to Prague. Randy and his brother decided to tag along.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We thought that sounded fun, to go to Prague,\" he says. \"And so we got on the train with them as well, heading that way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But on board, plans went awry. Randy was traveling Europe with a US military ID, rather than a passport. His out-of-date paperwork didn't state that the Czech Republic, then still called Czechoslovakia, was one of the countries he could visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "When custom officials checked the documents midway through the train journey, Randy was instructed to get off the train right away, and head back in the opposite direction. He and his brother hastily grabbed their backpacks and prepared to disembark.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As we were basically getting kicked off the train, we walked by Katy and her friends and said, 'Hey, guys, sorry, we can't go to Prague with you guys. I'm getting kicked off the train,'\" says Randy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Randy's brother had to head back to the US shortly after, but Randy had more leave to use up. As he got off the Prague train, he made vague promises to reunite with Katy and her friends in Munich, Germany later that week.\n",

      "Here's another photo of the group in Berlin. Courtesy Katy Vernon\n",

      "\"I'm like, 'Well, I don't know what to do now. But I guess I'll just go to Munich and see if I can meet up with them,'\" recalls Randy. \"But I wasn't 100% sure if they said they'd be in Munich in two days or three days.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was 1991, none of the travelers had cell phones or email addresses. Randy had no way of contacting Katy and her friends to confirm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what the heck, I have nothing to lose,\" Randy recalls thinking. He decided to take a chance, and travel to Munich in the hope of finding them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I found when the next train was coming in from Prague, I went down to the train platform and just sat there til the train arrived.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Katy couldn't believe it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I liked Randy, I thought he was really likable and fun,\" recalls Katy. \"I just remember walking around this beautiful garden somewhere in Prague thinking, 'I guess I'll never see him again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And then when we got off the train, I was the first one to spot his bright jacket, I shouted, 'Oh, my God, it's Randy!'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To me, that was kind of even more amazing than meeting someone on a train platform. It was meeting again, and the fact that he took that chance, not even knowing if it would be the right day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The group spent a couple of days together exploring Munich, and then traveled down to Venice, Italy. From there, they headed to the Greek islands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Katy's friends had visited Greece before, and just wanted to sunbathe and relax. But it was Katy and Randy's first time in the country, so they spent the days sightseeing as a pair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So we really spent a lot of time together and really just kind of built up a friendship,\" says Katy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We were out swimming together and going and getting food together,\" recalls Randy.\n",
      "\n",
      "On one of the boat trips between the Greek islands, the group traveled overnight. Katy and her friends had sleeping bags, and rolled them out on the top deck to keep warm. Randy didn't have anything to sleep on other than his bright blue coat, so Katy suggested he could share hers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Literally just to stay warm,\" says Randy. \"It was still very platonic.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "By then, both Katy and Randy thought their friendship could be something more. But they didn't want to cross a line while they were traveling together. They figured it could make things awkward -- and Katy and her friends had made a pact of sorts that they wouldn't let any vacation romances change their plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Randy liked Katy's friends too, and didn't want to upset their equilibrium.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They were fun, and they were very nice to me,\" he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, as time went on, Katy and Randy grew closer. She opened up to him about the death of her parents. He was a good listener, and recognized she needed someone who would allow her to vent without judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd been through a lot in my life up until then, and lots of kind of heartache with losing my parents at a young age. So I just never wanted to be with someone that would bring me drama and kind of add to that stress,\" says Katy. \"And I was very, very immediately just attracted to just what a nice, calm, funny person he was.\"\n",

      "Only a week or so after they were all back in the UK, Katy and one of her other friends from the trip traveled to visit Randy at his RAF base.\n",

It felt more grounded.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "When Randy returned to the US in May 1992, he and Katy -- sort of -- broke up. The long distance was daunting for them both, but especially for Randy, who felt he was starting a new chapter in his life, and wasn't sure how to juggle a girlfriend in England.\n",

      "News:  CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "“Avatar: The Way of Water” is setting box office records and generating Oscar buzz, which recently got director James Cameron reflecting on a moment he had celebrating one of his other big films.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cameron revealed in a conversation with CNN’s Chris Wallace for a new episode of “Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace?” that he regrets quoting a line from “Titanic” during his acceptance speech for best director at the 1998 Academy Awards.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mom, dad, there is no way that I can express to you what I’m feeling right now,” Cameron said during the ceremony. “My heart is full to bursting, except to say, ‘I’m the king of the world!’”\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the moment, Wallace asked Cameron: “How bad was the backlash in Hollywood? The feeling that Jim Cameron was riding a little too high at that point?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Cameron clarified that what was perceived by some to be “arrogance” was not how he was feeling on stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was trying to express the joy and excitement that I was feeling in terms of that movie – and the most joyful moment for Leonardo DiCaprio’s ‘Titanic’ character was when he was free and at the bow of the ship,” Cameron recalled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Titanic” won 11 Oscars that night, including best picture, but Cameron said he also took home a valuable lesson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What I learned is you don’t quote your own movie to the Academy if you win, because it’s cringeworthy,” he told Wallace. “It makes the assumption that you didn’t win by a narrow margin, but that every single person sitting in the audience on that night at the Kodak Theatre saw and loved ‘Titanic.’ And we’ll never know how much we won by, but it might not have been a landslide at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I took flack for all 25 years after that,” Cameron continued. “You do have to be careful what you say in your acceptance speech, me and Sally Field, we have a little self-help group together on this.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1985, Field won her second Academy Award for her performance in “Places in the Heart.” She later became a punchline for saying, “I can’t deny the fact that you like me. Right now, you like me!”\n",

      "“It’s 2023 and I really, really wanted to send out a positive message at the beginning of the year, but recent events have made that impossible,” Jackman said jokingly.\n",

It would. I mean, I have to spend a year with him shooting ‘Wolverine and ‘Deadpool.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "He wrapped up with, “So, just to recap: love ‘Spirited,’ love Will, love Octavia, love the song ‘Good Afternoon.’ But please, please, from the bottom of my heart, do not validate Ryan Reynolds in this way. Please.”\n",

      "“I understand that you’re set to play in the next ‘Deadpool’ movie, even though your character Logan or Wolverine was killed off in the last movie, you’re gonna play Wolverine again for the 10th time. Why?” Wallace asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I mean, you categorize it as the ‘Deadpool’ movie. We like to call a ‘Wolverine 10’ in our house,” Jackman quipped in response.\n",
      "\n",
      "The actor said he plans to train for six months to get in physical form to the return to the role, which in the past meant him eating about “19 chickens a day.”\n",

      "Jennifer Shah, a cast member on Bravo’s “Real Housewives of Salt Lake City,” was sentenced to six and a half years in prison for defrauding thousands of victims in a long-running telemarketing scheme that targeted the elderly and vulnerable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Judge Sidney Stein ordered the sentence of 78 months, along with five years of supervised release.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shah – the latest reality figure whose fraud was exposed by their fame-seeking over-the-top lifestyle – had asked for a three-year sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had faced up to 14 years under the sentencing guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shah’s defense attorney, Priya Chaudhry, released a statement on Friday, stating Shah “deeply regrets the mistakes that she has made and is profoundly sorry to the people she has hurt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jen has faith in our justice system, understands that anyone who breaks the law will be punished, and accepts this sentence as just,” the statement said. “Jen will pay her debt to society and when she is a free woman again, she vows to pay her debt to the victims harmed by her mistakes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I take full responsibility’\n",
      "\n",
      "Judge Stein called Shah an “integral” member of the decade-long fraud scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shah, who was wearing a camel pantsuit, blouse, and leopard print stiletto heels, said, her voice cracking, “First and foremost I am deeply sorry for what I have done. I take full responsibility for my actions and I’m doing all I can to fix the harm I have caused.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m so sorry for the agony and significant financial loss each of you have endured,” she said of the victims.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shah broke down sobbing as she apologized to her husband and two sons, who were present in the packed courtroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shah, who was arrested in March 2021, pleaded guilty in July to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. As part of her guilty plea Shah agreed to forfeit $6.5 million and pay up to $9.5 million in restitution to the victims.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prosecutors asked the judge to sentence Shah to 10 years in prison, writing in a letter that Shah is “the most culpable person charged in this case.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On Friday, Stein questioned Shah’s attorney why Shah’s written statement said nothing about her concern for the victims of the fraud and pointed out how she took steps to hide her fraud, including moving bank accounts to Kosovo and Cyprus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prosecutor Robert Sobelman said the evidence would be “devastating” if the case had gone to trial. He said Shah showed no remorse toward the victims and her texts messages revealed she was laughing with co-conspirators about them, asking if they had gotten one victim to “stop crying yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the sentencing was underway Shah sat next to her husband, Sharrieff Shah, who clasped her hand. Her two sons were seated on the other side of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roughly 20 of Shah’s family members and friends took up four rows of seats in the courtroom, which was at capacity with reporters, fans of the show and others in attendance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Missing from the benches were any of her castmates from the reality series.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shah’s attorney said she is no longer selling “Free Jen” or “Justice for Jen” merchandise on her website and any proceeds would go toward paying back victims.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reality v reality TV\n",
      "\n",
      "Shah is the latest star of a reality TV show, where private lives and ostentatious wealth are often on display, to be charged with wrongdoing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Teresa Giudice, of “The Real Housewives of New Jersey” franchise, was sentenced to 15 months in federal prison in 2014 after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy and three counts of bankruptcy fraud. She served 11 and a half months in prison before being released in 2015.\n",
      "\n",
      "In June, Todd and Julie Chrisley, of USA’s “Chrisley Knows Best,” were found guilty of conspiracy to defraud banks out of more than $30 million in fraudulent loans and evading taxes, and last month, they were sentenced to federal prison for their convictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shah was arrested in 2021 while Bravo was filming the second season of the reality TV series, with episodes of the show featuring Shah and her castmates speculating – and sparring – over her culpability. Shah had, at the time episodes aired, consistently professed her innocence, going as far as to state in a tagline for show promos that, “the only thing I’m guilty of is being ‘Shah-mazing.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "Prosecutors alleged from 2012 until March 2021, Shah and others sold so-called “business services” to the alleged victims, including website design services to some elderly individuals who didn’t own computers. At times, she worked from an office in Manhattan.\n",
      "\n",
      "As investigations into the telemarketing organization were underway and other members of it were arrested, prosecutors say, Shah continued to operate the fraudulent scheme, and took steps to conceal her conduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She directed others to lie, she put businesses and bank accounts in the name of others, she required payment in cash, she instructed others to delete text messages and electronic documents, she moved some of her operations overseas, and she tried to put computers and other evidence beyond the reach of investigators,” prosecutors wrote in a sentencing submission.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The defendant, appearing to mock the charges in this case, also claimed that ‘the only thing I’m guilty of is being Shah-mazing,’” prosecutors wrote in the court filing, citing her tagline on the Bravo reality series.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shah’s attorneys asked the judge to ignore her portrayal on the show.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just as Jen Shah has never been a ‘housewife,’ little else is real about her persona and caricature as portrayed by the editors of ‘RHOSLC,’” her attorneys wrote in their sentencing submission.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shah submitted 30 letters of support from family and friends – none came from her current cast members who she had volatile relationships with over the two seasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "She asked to serve her sentence at the federal prison in Bryan, Texas.\n"

      "Title:  What 'Avatar' box office does (and doesn't) tell us about going to the movies\n",
      "News:  CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "Like “Titanic” a quarter-century ago (which is a lifetime in media years), “Avatar: The Way of Water” is swimming against the usual box-office tides – triumphantly so. Yet searching for lessons in the film’s commercial success as the industry seeks beacons of hope about movie-going defies simple answers in much the way Pandora’s floating islands defy gravity.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s easy to forget that director James Cameron’s “Titanic,” a hugely expensive venture at the time, didn’t open particularly well, causing panic within the two studios that released it. The three-hour plus movie then proceeded to buck the trend toward theatrical revenue being frontloaded and steep post-first weekend drops, sailing to the No. 1 spot for 15 consecutive weeks, as film-goers flocked to see it, with some (teenage girls were an especially key cohort) returning multiple times.\n",
      "\n",
      "History is seemingly repeating itself, as “Avatar 2” is following a similar course after its debut prompted some box-office watchers to question whether its studio, Disney, could ever recoup its massive investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those concerns were understandable. Indeed, the skew of theatrical revenue toward opening weekends had already become more sharply pronounced before the pandemic and streaming hastened that behavioral shift.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it stands, people not motivated to rush out right away increasingly appear content to wait and consume movies on their ever-bigger TVs at home. Even Marvel’s major sequels of 2022 (featuring Doctor Strange, Thor and Black Panther) weren’t immune to that phenomenon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Avatar” has not only surged past those films but now seems poised for a prolonged period of theatrical dominance, thanks in part to the pandemic and streaming having contributed to thinning the herd in term of competition. At its present pace, it could be the first movie to top $2 billion worldwide since “Avengers: Endgame” in 2019 (although “Spider-Man: No Way Home” came close).\n",
      "\n",
      "Cameron’s epic is overcoming multiple factors that ought to have worked against it, none more so than its three-hour-plus length, which means theaters can run the movie fewer times in a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Avatar: The Way of the Water' debuted on Dec. 16. Disney\n",
      "\n",
      "Theoretically, that endurance-test running time tends to both scare away casual movie-goers and depress theatrical totals – an issue cited in regard to “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” which runs a half-hour shorter; and “Babylon,” a star-studded spin on Hollywood’s silent era that was basically dead on arrival box office-wise, which has generally been the fate of most of the year’s awards bait.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, what sets “Avatar 2” apart? Most obviously, it’s a movie that screams “spectacle,” fueling the desire to see it in theaters – particularly on Imax screens and in 3D – even if that meant not rushing out to watch it right away. Where Marvel movies (especially the sequels) inspire fans to catch them early to avoid spoilers, Cameron’s film hinges more on the experience than the details.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Avatar” has also performed inordinately well internationally, as the first movie did, in part because its simple themes and stunning visuals bridge issues of language or culture better than most movies can. Thus far, roughly two-thirds of its global box-office haul has come from outside North America, a significantly higher percentage than other pandemic-era hits like “Top Gun: Maverick” (a 48% domestic/52% international split) or the aforementioned Marvel titles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sequel to 'Avatar' has grossed more than $1 billion so far. 20th Century Studios\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the desperation to lure people back to theaters, the question will inevitably be what Hollywood and theaters can glean from “Avatar’s” example. The truth is, not very much.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Indiewire noted, the “grim reality” for movie distributors is among the new year-end films released, “Avatar” was the lone entry with anything to truly celebrate as 2022 came to a close.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like the fauna on Pandora, “Avatar” might be a unique animal, running counter to prevailing habits. The quest to find “another ‘Avatar,’” in other words, could easily yield as many expensive misses as bona fide hits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Already, Hollywood is expressing optimism about 2023, with an impressive arsenal of identifiable titles to attract people to theaters, starting in February with “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The show must go on, and hope springs eternal. For now, though, “The Way of Water” doesn’t share much in common with the current ways of movie-going. And after a 13-year gap between the original and the sequel, for Disney and theaters, “Avatar 3” can’t come soon enough.\n",

      "After a sterling start with “Interview With the Vampire,” AMC’s plan to build a cinematic universe around its gothic author casts less of a spell with “Anne Rice’s Mayfair Witches.” Moody, erotic and reasonably well paced at first, the series yields diminishing returns over the episodes previewed as it slowly teases out another “you are the chosen one”-type plot.\n",

      "\n",
      "Daddario is appropriately confused by the strange world into which she’s stumbled, and the birthright she appears to have inherited.

      "AMC is clearly playing a long and more intricate game, and “Mayfair Witches” has enough going for it that it’s not worth writing the concept off just yet; still, the underwhelming introduction offers a reminder that best-laid plans for a movie or TV “universe” are usually only as good as the individual components that populate it.\n",

      "Technology run amok and killer dolls (from “The Twilight Zone’s” Talking Tina to Chucky) are hardly new ideas, but “M3GAN” nevertheless finds a way to smartly add to the genre, with a crisp and funny horror tale made tastier because it’s set about 10 minutes in the future.

      "\n",
      "Produced by horror factory Blumhouse and “The Conjuring’s” James Wan (who shares story credit with screenwriter Akela Cooper), the film stars Allison Williams as the equivalent of a well-intentioned mad scientist whose best-laid plans go horrifically wrong.\n",

      "Adding to her horror credentials from “Get Out,” Williams’ Gemma is forced to take in her suddenly orphaned nine-year-old niece, Cady (Violet McGraw), who lost mom and dad in a car accident.

      "Title:  ‘Avatar: The Way of Water’ rekindles the wonder in a way that demands to be seen\n",
      "News:  CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "“Avatar” took a very basic story and adorned it with eye-popping spectacle, in a way that made the film a must-see commodity, and a record-breaking hit in the process. Thirteen years later, braving much different theatrical tides, director James Cameron has done it again with “Avatar: The Way of Water,” a state-of-the-art exercise that rekindles that sense of wonder and demands to be seen by anyone with lingering interest in watching movies in theaters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Cameron (who shares script credit with Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver) has already announced plans for multiple “Avatar” sequels, the filmmaker has thrown so much technical wizardry, scope and scale into this 190-minute epic that one gets the impression he approached directing it as if there might never be another, leaving everything on the field – or rather, the waves.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, “The Way of Water” introduces an entirely new Na’vi subculture of reef people, with their own evolutionary adaptations and remarkable fauna with which they bond, wedding the original to Cameron’s well-documented love of the ocean and its exploration, an impulse he’s been indulging since “Titanic” a quarter-century ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with the 2009 movie, the plot to “The Way of Water” is hardly groundbreaking, but rather a cleverly assembled treatise on the sins of imperialism, an environmental message and, in the main wrinkle, family dynamics, constructed in a way that affords each of the children their own issues but largely avoids the Disney Channel-style missteps that might ensue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sequel picks up many years later, with Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) now the proud parents of four kids, still finding time for “date nights” that consist of euphorically soaring above the Pandora landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Happiness is simple,” Jake explains in voiceover, until the “sky people” return to again lay siege to their paradise, this time motivated by a “WALL-E”-type dilemma that involves having polluted Earth beyond habitability, making the commander of this mission (played by Edie Falco) speak of the imperative to “pacify the hostiles.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Video Ad Feedback James Cameron shares details on 'Avatar 2' 03:27 - Source: CNN\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of concern for protecting his family, which Jake repeatedly describes as a father’s primary mission, he chooses to seek refuge with the aforementioned water clan, the Metkayina. He finds a more receptive greeting from their king (Cliff Curtis) than their queen (Kate Winslet, in what can be described as a “‘Titanic’ reunion” in more ways than one).\n",
      "\n",
      "Fleeing, of course, will only delay the seemingly inevitable showdown, but it offers a chance to introduce a rich new culture as well as expose both parents and their progeny to the adjustment their new surroundings require. The children, in particular, must grapple with the personalities and pettiness associated with becoming the new kids on the reef.\n",
      "\n",
      "Far from shying away from the minutia assorted with all that, Cameron luxuriates in it and invites the audience to do the same. From the first striking 3D images that practically leap off the screen, “The Way of Water” basks in speed and movement, as if this was all an audition for the inevitable additions to Disney World’s theme-park attraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The simplicity of the story provides license to indulge in the dazzling visuals and state-of-the-art performance-capture techniques, which despite fewer human characters this time around prove authentic enough that it almost never feels as if you’re watching an animated film.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, Cameron extends sequences for long stretches but seldom produces a dull moment, with the notable exception coming during the final battle, which keeps piling on threats and escapes that easily could have been truncated or tightened.\n",
      "\n",
      "That note amounts to a quibble, though, with a film that brings a full-throated roar to celebrating theatrical movie-going as a singular experience, practically daring the viewer to resist its muscularity and power.\n",
      "\n",

      "Title:  'Babylon' review: Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie star in Damien Chazelle's version of 'Singin' in the Rain' on steroids\n",
      "News:  CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "After romanticizing Hollywood in “La La Land,” Damien Chazelle widens his “Another Day of Sun” lens to explore the town’s dark roots in “Babylon,” which is basically another dawn-of-talkies era “Singin’ in the Rain” on a cocktail of ampethamines and steroids. Despite a stellar cast and showy moments (given who’s involved how could there not be?), the writer-director’s sprawling, messy, three-hour-plus endurance test isn’t ready for its closeup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following multiple characters and mixing in close-to-reality versions of Hollywood lore to ground the exercise, “Babylon” opens with a sensory-overload illustration of early showbiz decadence and debauchery circa 1926. In a not-too-subtle symbol of that, the film opens with a low-level studio employee (Diego Calva) hauling an elephant up a hill to serve as an accessory at an absurdly lavish party (OK, orgy, but given what’s to come, it’s not worth quibbling about semantics).\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s more than 30 minutes before the title blasts across the screen, but by then, Chazelle has introduced most of the key characters, including an aging Douglas Fairbanks-like star (Brad Pitt) on wife No. Whatever, a talented musician (Jovan Adepo), and a tough-as-nails wannabe actress (Margot Robbie, stealing every scene she’s in) who announces, “I’m already a star,” and then when asked what movies she’s been in says, “Nothing yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s also the gossip columnist (Jean Smart), the exotic entertainer (Li Jun Li) and an assortment of strivers and stars, with everyone having boarded the same escalator, the only question being whether their side is heading up or going down.\n",
      "\n",
      "The advent of sound pictures shakes everything up in a big way, just as it did in “Singin’ in the Rain,” setting the stage for career-making rises and tragic falls.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s some poignance in that, but Chazelle comes bounding out of the gate so aggressively – with such over-the-top flourishes, from projectile vomiting to the elephant relieving itself at an unfortunate time – that it’s difficult to care much about most of the cartoon-quality personalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Margot Robbie (center) in director Damien Chazelle's \"Babylon.\" Scott Garfield/Paramount Pictures\n",
      "\n",
      "“Babylon” rallies a bit toward the end, but unlike the way time passes watching “Avatar: The Way of Water,” another movie that cries out for the good ol’ days of intermissions, the middle portion bogs down while laboring to get there. In that sense, the truck with the elephant turns out to be a pretty good metaphor, just not in the most flattering of ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thematically, there’s also a vague sense of wistfulness for the freewheeling excess of the time – back when a dead body could be treated as an inconvenience – at a moment when Hollywood and other industries have been forced to look hard at the misconduct that kind of environment allowed to fester.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps foremost, “Babylon” feels like a case of providing a talented filmmaker unfettered license to make the movie he wanted to make, when a few judicious notes – whether that involved trimming the length or curbing a scene – actually would have been helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another key difference from “Avatar,” “Babylon” lacks the connection to established intellectual property that might coax more people to brave that daunting length.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hollywood’s infatuation with its earlier self is well documented, as movies from “Sunset Boulevard” to “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood” attest. Already a Golden Globe nominee (oddly classified as a “musical or comedy”), “Babylon” could be an awards player despite its flaws thanks to that dynamic, fueled by its star power and tantalizing subject matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, though, Chazelle has delivered another valentine to the magic, power and history of movies – and yes, the ideal of watching them with all those wonderful people in the dark – that given current trends, even those with a taste for this overcooked stew will likely end up streaming.\n",

      "News:  CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "Adam Driver and writer-director Noah Baumbach follow their collaboration on the dour “Marriage Story” with a considerably quirkier Netflix movie in “White Noise,” a faithful adaptation of Don DeLillo’s 1985 novel that loses a great deal in translation. Baumbach’s pandemic-inspired undertones resonate on that level, but it’s played in such stilted fashion as to make “White Noise” pretty easy to tune out.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s a personal quality to the film, which includes casting Baumbach’s partner, Greta Gerwig, who has been busily making her own mark as a director, including the upcoming “Barbie.” In a way, her off-kilter performance encapsulates both the David Lynch-ian aspect that Baumbach was seeking to achieve and how it misfires, feeling precious in a way that makes it difficult to buy into much of what’s on screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sporting the kind of “dad bod” that doesn’t exactly dovetail with all the social-media thirst directed his way, Driver plays Jack Gladney, a college professor in Hitler Studies. He’s on his fourth wife, Babette (Gerwig), with a quartet of kids from the couple’s various marriages and a circle of pompous overly educated friends, the most prominent of which is played by Don Cheadle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon, however, trouble begins to intrude on their odd little bubble, including a toxic spill with potentially dire consequences (your pandemic metaphor, lest anyone miss it) and Jack’s growing suspicions regarding his wife’s behavior, which strains their perfect-for-each-other-in-an-odd-way relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Cheadle and Adam Driver in \"White Noise.\" Wilson Webb/Netflix\n",
      "\n",
      "Baumbach has developed a well-deserved reputation as an auteur with films like “The Squid and the Whale” and “The Meyerowitz Stories,” and while Kanye West and others have complicated the always-dicey notion of using Hitler as a sly punchline, the satirical view of eccentric academics feels like the movie’s most sure-footed gag. Between the Hitler component, the movie’s preoccupation with death and the way the leads interact, the film strongly brings to mind some of Woody Allen’s movies.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s everything else that falls pretty flat, from the shadowy threat of the chemical disaster – and the chaos that ensues – to the trouble in paradise that assails Jack and Babette’s marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Netflix has created a haven for prestige filmmakers by financing movies that would likely struggle box-office-wise. It’s an arrangement that provides the streaming service with media attention seeking and the promotional advantages associated with landing a place in the film awards competition in exchange for artistic freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "With “Marriage Story,” the recipient of six Oscar nominations, the relationship proved mutually beneficial. This time Baumbach hasn’t held up his end of that bargain, in a movie that lives down to its name.\n",

      "Title:  'Paul T. Goldman' review: The 'Borat' sequel's director blends fiction and reality in a way that's as odd as it is funny\n",
      "News:  CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "The term “hybrid” is thrown around too loosely in entertainment, but it genuinely applies to “Paul T. Goldman,” a Peacock series from the director of the “Borat” sequel that combines fiction with sort-of reality, scripted with a behind-the-scenes “making of” docuseries. Quirky and odd, the show’s main point feels like the fact we’re all the heroes of our story, at least in our own highly subjective eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s honestly hard to know where to begin in describing the program, which, hilariously, makes note of the fact that after years of shooting and pitching the project, its first nibble was from Quibi. Of course, that “quick bites” streaming service quickly folded, allowing Peacock to step into the void. Critics also received five of the six episodes, and how the show ends, based on what precedes it, is a significant question mark.\n",
      "\n",
      "For starters, “Paul T. Goldman” isn’t the real name of the central character, who claims that he was fleeced by his second wife, a scam artist who married him for his money and professed to be tending to an elderly relative during her lengthy absences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Goldman (it gets confusing to call him anything else) became obsessed with unearthing details about the scheme, writing a book and film treatment about the experience. So Woliner shoots those scenes with Goldman as the awkward star of his own movie opposite real actors – including recognizable players like Dennis Haysbert, Frank Grillo, James Remar and Dee Wallace – then makes the viewer privy to all the off-screen shenanigans, as Goldman interacts with his confused but polite co-stars, who (understandably) don’t seem to know what to make of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m a regular guy who got caught up in extraordinary circumstances,” he contends during the direct-to-camera interviews, insisting that “Nobody could make up” this story. Later, though, Goldman freely admits that parts of his screenplay version have been fabricated or embellished for dramatic effect, further blurring the lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to complicate matters further, Woliner himself is a regular presence in the film – fielding his star’s strange requests and suggestions that Goldman thinks will improve things – while weaving in photos, video and audio of actual characters, sometimes with their faces obscured.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the episodes proceed, it becomes clear that Goldman has fudged details about much of what transpired, making it difficult to take what he says at face value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like “Borat,” there’s discomfort and comedy in this nexus of fiction and manipulated reality, and the extent to which Goldman appears oblivious to how he might look when all of this gets edited together. Is it cruel to indulge his delusions of grandeur? Given that he appears to be having the time of his life, it’s hard to tell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Produced by Seth Rogen’s company, “Paul T. Goldman” obviously comes during a boom time for true-crime docuseries, which frequently employ reenactments to heighten the drama. Woliner has essentially taken that practice to bizarre extremes, creating something that manages to feel fresh and occasionally quite funny, if a little cringe inducing at times.\n",
      "\n",
      "The net result is a show that’s as oddly watchable as it is hard to define. If only Quibi had lived to see it.\n",

      "News:  CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "“Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test” began with the disclaimer “Do Not Attempt This at Home,” which seems unnecessary and silly, unless you have the resources to fly to Jordan and an unquenchable appetite for 15 minutes of fame. As is, 16 celebrities (and sort-of celebrities) take the plunge, in an unscripted Fox series whose premiere felt heavy-handed even by the genre’s standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Narrated with the kind of brooding solemnity that wouldn’t be out of place on an episode of “Succession,” the format resembles an old Fox show called “Boot Camp,” a competition in which drill instructors put contestants through the paces of military training.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, there’s no pot of gold at the rainbow’s end, just a lot of physical and emotional torment, as a quartet of tough-talking trainers spend much of their time shouting at the contestants, with a handful failing to survive (figuratively, not literally) the two-hour premiere.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Remember, you volunteered to come into our world,” the players are told by one of the trainers, which seems worth recalling when they’re asked to leap headfirst into water from a helicopter or cross a 300-foot ravine while tethered to ropes more than 100 feet above the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure, there’s a lot of talk about embracing the challenge and testing their limits, but there’s also a tiresome amount of theatricality in the presentation, which includes throwing bags over the players’ heads when they’re brought in for “interrogation,” which sort of doubles as therapy sessions.\n",

      "\n",
      "The elevated drama notwithstanding, some of the challenges genuinely appear pretty harrowing, and it doesn’t require much in the way of acting chops to look apprehensive when gawking at the ravine test. Indeed, scanning some of the reaction shots, the title of another old reality show, the “Survivor”-like “I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!,” comes to mind.\n",

      "It’s not hard, seeing these big stunts, to put oneself in the participants’ shoes, which coupled with the celebrity angle could be a source of initial curiosity and media attention.

A blacker-than-black satire on the evils and pratfalls of modern dating, “Fresh” features Sebastian Stan as a way-too-good-to-be-true plastic surgeon who pursues young women to eventually trap them in his remote mansion and take pieces of them for an elite underground community of flesh eaters who pay top dollar for the, er, freshest cuts. The movie deftly teeters between hard-to-watch and tongue-in-cheek, ultimately providing an ending that gives new meaning to the term “just desserts.”\n",

      "And then there was Netflix’s “Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,” which was the streaming giant’s most-watched new show in its first week at the time in September. This Ryan Murphy series had many viewers unable to finish watching even the first episode. If that weren’t enough on the notorious cannibalistic serial killer, October saw the premiere of a third installment of the “Conversations With a Killer” series, also on Netflix, this one focusing on Dahmer.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of these were a few very attention-getting “cannibal-adjacent” titles, like Showtime’s “Yellowjackets,” which came out late last year but got more legs this year. The series is an atmospheric new take on the “Lost” trope, this one following a group of women who survived a harrowing experience following a plane crash that left them stranded in the wilderness for over a year when they were teens. And while there is no explicit cannibalism in the show as of yet, “Yellowjackets” kind of dangles the idea but seems to be saving the real meat of it (sorry) for next year’s Season 2.\n",

      "This definitely isn’t the first time cannibals have captured the zeitgeist. After all, Anthony Hopkins won his first best actor Oscar for only 16 minutes of screentime as the murderous flesh eater Hannibal Lecter in 1991’s “The Silence of the Lambs.” The San Diego Museum Of Man’s strange and mystifying “Cannibals: Myth & Reality” exhibit explains that cannibalism is actually not as foreign as one might think, spanning cultures and history, from European royalty to American colonists, as well as unlucky sailors and accident survivors.

      "Yuè Begay, a Navajo artist and activist, called for a boycott of the film in a tweet that’s since received more than 47,000 likes, while Autumn Asher Blackdeer, a scholar from the Southern Cheyenne Nation, compiled a widely shared list of Indigenous-led sci-fi films for viewers to watch instead. Countless others have also weighed in with their own complaints, with some – including Begay – calling out remarks made by Cameron in earlier interviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "The “Avatar” franchise isn’t subtle in its anti-colonial, anti-imperialist and environmentalist themes – Cameron has said as much, previously referring to the first film as “a science fiction retelling of the history of North and South America in the early colonial period.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“(Cameron) might be telling that story of colonization, but he’s telling it through the lens of a White male,” she told CNN.\n",

      "“The Way of Water” does go a little deeper than its predecessor. It introduces the Metkayina people of the reef in a nod to the Māori, in an attempt to showcase the diversity of Indigenous peoples around the world. It also casts Cliff Curtis, who is of Māori descent, as Metkayina chief Tonowari. But many of the other characters are still voiced by White actors.\n",

      "Adam Piron, a filmmaker and director of the Indigenous program at Sundance Institute, said he hasn’t yet seen the latest installment of the “Avatar” franchise, though he plans to.

      "“It’s based on what James Cameron’s notion is of what he thinks Indigenous history is, what he thinks Indigenous culture is,” she said. “Everyone thinks that we’re a monolith. What it does is flatten who Indigenous peoples are, what Indigenous cultures, language, practices are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Part of the outrage around the sequel has also stemmed from recently resurfaced comments that Cameron made in 2010 to The Guardian as he joined the Xingu people in the Amazon in their fight against a dam project. Witnessing Indigenous ceremonies in the Amazon, Cameron said, prompted him to consider the plight of Native peoples in North America.\n",

      "Cameron responded to criticism of “Avatar” earlier this month, telling British media site Unilad that “the important thing is to listen and to be sensitive to issues that people have.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s not up to me, speaking from a perspective of White privilege, if you will, to tell them that they’re wrong,” he said of his critics. “It has validity. It’s pointless for me to say, ‘Well, that was never my intention.’”\n",

      "Title:  Why 'nepo babies' are all over the internet right now\n",
      "News:  CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the surest roads to success in showbiz is to be the child of an already famous and successful person.\n",
      "\n",
      "These progeny are called nepo babies (nepo = nepotism), and they have not-so-secretly infiltrated countless beloved pop culture properties. Who was your favorite character on “Stranger Things”? Robin, was it? Nepo baby. Your favorite feline anti-hero in “The Batman”? Yeah, she’s a nepo baby. If you preferred the Riddler in that film, some news – his real-life partner is a nepo baby, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "That these famous and successful folks were the children or relatives of other famous and successful folks isn’t a surprise: It’s hard to forget who Maya Hawke and Zoë Kravitz are related to when they look like the spitting image of their famous parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the term “nepo baby” is a relatively new one, a phrase that’s inspired guilt and anxiety among those it describes. The latest issue of New York magazine highlighted dozens of nepo babies, even putting a few of them back in diapers in a star-studded maternity ward for its cover.\n",
      "\n",
      "The issue went off like a bomb, shocking readers by laying out famous lineages and even including a surprise nepo baby or two. Some fans defended their idols; others applauded the magazine for its audacity to potentially alienate countless celebrities. A few of those celebs mentioned chimed in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nepo babies lead beloved streaming series and earn awards notice. They’ve starred on Broadway and have fronted major fashion campaigns. Some are widely beloved. Some are Chet Hanks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Put simply, per New York’s Nate Jones: “A nepo baby is physical proof that meritocracy is a lie.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A brief history of the nepo baby\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nepo baby” refers to the kid of successful adults who’s benefited from nepotism in industries like entertainment or adjacent fields (fashion and media are two of the other big ones). Unlike bootstrappers and naturally talented “nobodies,” nepo babies start off with an advantage – their parents’ connections – although many of them later claim their parentage is a burden when it comes to carving out their own names.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nepo baby buzz this year kicked off after HBO’s controversial smash “Euphoria” aired its second season. Some young viewers were shocked to learn that cast member Maude Apatow is the daughter of director Judd Apatow (“Knocked Up,” “This is 40”) and actress Leslie Mann (also “Knocked Up,” “This is 40”). “Euphoria” director Sam Levinson is a “nepo-baby” himself – he’s the son of successful director Barry Levinson, with whom he co-wrote the HBO film “The Wizard of Lies” before helming “Euphoria.”\n",

      "\n",
      "These connections surprised some young users on TikTok, who launched investigations into other relatively under-the-radar nepo babies. (Many of the most well-known nepo babies peaked in terms of fame before Gen Z was old enough to remember them.) These videos popularized the term “nepo baby.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The nepo baby debate reached new heights in November when Lily Rose Depp, daughter of Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis who’s also set to star in a Sam Levinson series, rejected the term in an interview with Elle: “The internet cares a lot more about who your family is than the people who are casting you in things. Maybe you get your foot in the door, but you still just have your foot in the door. There’s a lot of work that comes after that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Critics pounced, including rising supermodel Vittoria Ceretti, who’s worked for fashion houses like Chanel (and for whom Depp has modeled since her teens). “I have many nepo baby friends whom I respect, but I can’t stand listening to you compare yourself to me,” Ceretti said in an Instagram story. “I was not born on a comfy sexy pillow with a view. I know it’s not your fault, but please, appreciate and know the place you came from.”\n",
      "\n",
      "All this inspired New York magazine’s pop culture vertical, Vulture, to launch a year-end series on nepo babies, which included an exhaustive taxonomy of famous kids (and the less-famous kids of über-famous parents).\n",
      "\n",
      "Who’s who in the nepo baby-verse\n",
      "\n",
      "Vulture’s spread made clear that the universe of nepo babies is vast and potentially endless. There are the young stars: Maya Hawke is the progeny of Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke, and indie darling Riley Keough is Elvis’ granddaughter. There are plenty of long-established nepo babies, too, like Zoë Kravitz (Lenny Kravitz and Lisa Bonet), Kate Hudson (Goldie Hawn and stepdad Kurt Russell) and Gwyneth Paltrow (Blythe Danner, director Bruce Paltrow).\n",
      "\n",
      "A few entries on the list were surprising: Two of the three members of “Please Don’t Destroy,” NYU alums who create digital shorts for “Saturday Night Live,” are the sons of “SNL” producers. Sisters Rooney and Kate Mara are members of two NFL founding families. And “Fantastic Beasts” actress Katherine Waterston is the British-accented daughter of Sam Waterston, recently of “Grace and Frankie.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And then there are those who are so talented and/or established that their nepo-baby reputation doesn’t really matter anymore. Jamie Lee Curtis is the daughter of Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis. Dakota Johnson’s bonafides go back generations: She’s the granddaughter of “The Birds” icon Tippi Hedren and daughter of “Working Girl” Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson of “Miami Vice.” And Oscar winner/gay icon Laura Dern is the daughter of two Oscar nominees, Diane Ladd and Bruce Dern.\n",

      "Vulture found some interesting nepo baby trends, too: Eight of them appeared in Quentin Tarantinto’s “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood,” according to the outlet. All three of Meryl Streep’s daughters are actresses who’ve appeared on HBO. Several other nepo babies starred in HBO’s “Big Little Lies,” which also featured Alexander Skarsgård of the Skarsgårds. (HBO, which shares parent company Warner Bros. Discovery with CNN, is apparently a major employer of nepo babies.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Readers were surprised, outraged and delighted\n",
      "\n",
      "Reliably, the “stans” of the stars Vulture highlighted came out to support their idols, defending them for leveraging their fame and criticizing the magazine for pointing out their Google-able family history. (Note: “Stan” is another term for “diehard fan” popularized by Eminem, whose daughter Hailie is also included in Vulture’s list; she hosts a podcast.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Eve Hewson, an actress (“Bad Sisters,” “The Knick”) and Bono’s daughter, tweeted derisively several times about the article. “2023 Goals: be successful enough to get recognised as a nepo baby,” she wrote before she realized she’d been mentioned in an infographic.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then: “Omg please can all the Nepo babies unite and dress up as giant babies for Halloween.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The article reminded some of some of the mentioned nepo babies’ responses when asked about their privilege. Maya Hawke told Rolling Stone earlier this year that when it comes to the “nepotism thing,” she recognized that her lineage “definitely gives you massive advantages in this life” and while “you will get chances for free … the chances will not be infinite.” Maude Apatow, meanwhile, said the label made her “sad” but that she tries not to “let it get to (her) because (she) obviously understand(s) that (she’s) in such a lucky position.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Some critics pointed out that a few of the inclusions in Vulture’s compilation were a stretch: Phoebe Bridgers, for example, was included among “industry babies” as the “daughter of a set builder” next to young Oscar nominee Lucas Hedges, whose dad is a director and whose grandpa was an executive at HBO. To some of Bridgers’ fans, it seemed incongruous to compare the two stars’ industry connections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of Vulture’s chosen nepo babies have not responded to the spread or the brouhaha it raised. After all, many of them are so famous that they’re able to avoid engaging in trends like these altogether.\n"

      "News:  CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "Actors from the 1968 film “Romeo and Juliet” have filed a lawsuit against Paramount Studios, which produced the film, for allowing the movie to be released with scenes showing them nude when they were minors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawsuit, filed last week in Santa Monica Superior Court by stars Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting, accuses Paramount of sexual exploitation and distributing nude images of adolescent children.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a copy of the suit provided to CNN, the complaint alleges that the film’s director Franco Zeffirelli, who died in 2019 and is not named as a defendant in the suit, assured the actors that there would be no nudity, and that they would be able to “wear flesh colored undergarments during the bedroom/love scene.”\n",
      "\n",
      "However, according to the complaint, Zeffirelli later told Hussey and Whiting – who were 15 and 16 at the time, respectively – that ‘they must act in the nude or the Picture would fail.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The complaint also alleges that the actors were given body makeup and were told exactly where the camera would be positioned, and though the director assured them that no nudity would be photographed or released in the film, that is not what happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scene that was included in the film and shown in theaters featured images of both Whiting’s buttocks and Hussey’s bare breasts, the complaint states.\n",
      "\n",
      "CNN has attempted to reach legal representatives for Paramount Studios and Zeffirelli’s son for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawsuit seeks damages Hussey and Whiting say are believed to be in excess of $500 million. The actors both claim the scene has caused them mental anguish and emotional distress in the 55 years since the film’s release.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since it was filed at the end of 2022, it is not affected by the expiration of a California law that temporarily suspended the statute of limitations for older claims of child sexual abuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "The actors, now both in their 70s, also maintain they have lost out on job opportunities as a result.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What they were told and what went on were two different things,” Tony Marinozzi, a business manager for both actors, told Variety. “They trusted Franco. At 16, as actors, they took his lead that he would not violate that trust they had. Franco was their friend, and frankly, at 16, what do they do? There are no options. There was no #MeToo.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The actors’ attorney, Solomon Gresen, told the outlet that the nude scenes were shot when his clients “were very young naive children in the ’60s who had no understanding of what was about to hit them. All of a sudden they were famous at a level they never expected, and in addition they were violated in a way they didn’t know how to deal with.”\n",

      "Title:  What the Whitney Houston biopic reveals\n",
      "News:  Washington CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "“My whole life: ‘She ain’t Black enough. She ain’t White enough.’ Well, how about she’s not obedient enough? How ‘bout she ain’t fearful enough?”\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s Whitney Houston, played by Naomi Ackie, in Kasi Lemmons’ moving and elegant new biopic, “Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance With Somebody.” She’s responding to criticisms that she’s out of touch with Black audiences – that she’s merely an ingénue whose image and sound have been carefully constructed by White music executives to do just one thing: people-please.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scene is one of many in the movie neatly capturing the pressures the real-life Houston navigated as she walked a professional tightrope, trying to maintain her identity and integrity while meeting the demands of the record moguls who wanted her to tamp down her Blackness, behave “respectably” and quash even suggestions of queerness. The release of Lemmons’ film, which transports viewers to the world that begat the singer beloved as The Voice, offers us a chance to revisit her complex life and unmatched legacy with fresh eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "To do precisely that, I spoke with Emily Lordi, an English professor at Vanderbilt University and the author of the forthcoming book, “Holding Lightning: The Life, Loves and Art of Whitney Houston.”\n",
      "\n",
      "During our conversation, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity, we discussed how racial expectations loomed over Houston, what the recent spate of new work about the singer says about the current pop-cultural landscape and why it’s a mistake to overlook the Black, feminist work she did in her post-“Bodyguard” years.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are some of the challenges of producing a life narrative about Whitney, who reached fame on a planetary scale?\n",
      "\n",
      "She’s a very complex figure – that would be one thing. Part of her gift in being able to reach so many people was that she had a kind of chameleonic way about her, which was how she was able to embody various personae in her songs – from the fun, confused girl of “How Will I Know” to the ultimate patriot in the national anthem. But I think that she assumed slightly different roles, depending on the people she was with and just her mood, like anybody else. It can be challenging to take in the multi-dimensionality of her as a person.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then there’s her mastery as an artist. It can be hard to find the vocabulary to explain what made her such a great vocalist. I can ask people who have a better technical vocabulary than I do – for example, her longtime saxophonist, Kirk Whalum, or her protégée, Monica – what made her great. But I think that most of us regular people are hard-pressed to grasp the magnitude of her musical genius.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she was younger, Whitney was portrayed as an all-American girl, as a pop princess. We see in the movie that there was this sense that she “belonged” to everybody. But this dynamic revealed lots about the country’s anxieties around race.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that there was a sense early on that there would have to be a kind of flattening of Whitney’s image in order to make her palatable as a Black crossover star. In her book, Robyn Crawford talks about how some people didn’t like the cover image Whitney preferred for her first record (1985) because it looked “too Black.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And when you get to the cover for Whitney’s second album (1987), if you do a close reading of it, it’s just her on a vacant set. She’s obviously Black, but she’s got the weave at this point, and there’s nobody around. She’s youngish but not girlish. She’s sexy but not seductive. She looks prosperous but not rich. That, I’d argue, was the moment the label’s vision of Whitney, the American Everywoman, manifested most powerfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, we got 1990’s “I’m Your Baby Tonight.” The album showcases what I think is some of Whitney’s boldest work. She defies the sound that gave her superstardom; she embraces Black musical traditions: new jack swing, soul, gospel. The songs are more authoritative, more thematically mature. In other words, Whitney’s no longer a pop princess.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right. On the third album cover, she’s in a seemingly urban environment. She’s on a motorcycle. She’s got her nickname, “Nippy,” on the license plate. By the ’90s, she’s beginning to take more control over her image and sound. I mean that literally, in the sense of becoming more of a producer on the records.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to think about this shift from America’s sweetheart to a more Black-identified Whitney is to think about the move from her performance at the Super Bowl in 1991 during the Gulf War to her decision just three years later to perform in Nelson Mandela’s South Africa. By 1994, she’s like a global ambassador, bringing her majority-Black band. People didn’t really do that. It was a landmark decision for her to do that. I’m not suggesting that she ever suppressed her Blackness. I’m saying that she became freer in expressing it, as she acquired more power over her sound and image.\n",

      "We’re seeing an expanding collection of work, from feature films and documentaries to memoirs and critical texts, granting Whitney the sort of complexity she never received when she was alive. Why are we seeing a flowering of books and movies about her?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that there’s more general interest in “unruly women,” in trying to recover them, recuperate them, restore their complexity. We see that in a number of different instances. There’s the critical reappraisal of Nina Simone. There’s the interest in Britney Spears and pop icons who had been assumed to be vacant, unthinking ingénues. People now are realizing how much the tabloid industry and also just a racist, sexist culture mistreated these figures.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that change is thanks to the feminist movement, thanks to Black Lives Matter, thanks to #MeToo. There are a number of movements that you can point to that I think have collectively generated a cultural energy around revisiting women who were maligned, undermined and underestimated.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do people tend to miss in conversations about Whitney? As a Whitney superfan, I could come up with a litany of answers to this question …\n",
      "\n",
      "Where do I even begin? For one, how hard she worked to develop her talent. When we talk about the lineage from which she comes, it can seem like she’s the natural beneficiary of the grooming of Cissy Houston, the family connection to Dionne Warwick, the mentorship of Aretha Franklin and Chaka Khan, whom Whitney knew through her mother. And that she was just born with it; she just had those pipes.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s all true. But I think that when we accent those factors, we neglect how hard she had to work to develop her talent, to keep going when she wanted to quit. There are lots of other things a person of Whitney’s beauty and style and intelligence and talent might’ve decided to do. I don’t think that it was inevitable that she’d become a singer, never mind a global superstar. Or if it was divinely ordained, she also had to work for it. She had to make choices. She and Robyn had to strategize. This is a long way of saying that one thing we miss is the part Whitney played in becoming herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other thing that I want to focus on is the post-“Bodyguard” (1992) years, when she does some of her Blackest, most feminist work. And that period is treated as a total abyss. But she performed for Nelson Mandela. She acted in 1995’s “Waiting to Exhale,” and in 1996’s “The Preacher’s Wife.” She teamed up with people like Lauryn Hill, Missy Elliott, Faith Evans and Kelly Price on “My Love Is Your Love” (1998). She initiated projects that brought visibility to other Black women artists. 1997’s “Cinderella” is a great example of that. 2012’s “Sparkle” is a great example of that.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we act as if everything after “The Bodyguard” is like a freefall toward her untimely demise, we miss so much of what she was intentionally doing for the culture – even in the middle of all her struggles.\n"

      "News:  CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "Bringing vibrant energy to the translation from book to musical to screen, “Roald Dahl’s Matilda the Musical” lands on Netflix as a rewarding example of the perilous practice of building such efforts around children. Of course, it helps that the young star, Alisha Weir, is terrific, aided by wonderful turns from Emma Thompson and Lashana Lynch, extending what have already been good years for both.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dahl’s story about a little girl with absentee parents and unusual powers, sent to a boarding school run by the abusive, kid-hating Miss Trunchbull (Thompson, under a version of super-villain makeup), is certainly dark, even by the author’s standards. But as adapted for the stage by Tim Minchin, who wrote the songs, and directed here by Matthew Warchus, who has nicely opened up the staging in cinematic fashion, it’s a polished and fun alternative to less attractive holiday activities, like dealing with your family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the silliest controversy involved questions about Thompson donning a “fat suit,” when her Trunchbull makeover is as much about making her fearsome and imposing – befitting the character’s glory days as an Olympic athlete – as her girth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lest anyone forget, Thompson also previously buried herself under unflattering prosthetics in “Nanny McPhee,” and lustily portrayed a villain in Disney’s “Cruella.” In a year when she’s already delivered a standout performance in the low-key Hulu movie “Good Luck to You, Leo Grande,” her scene-stealing exploits offer a reminder of just how delicious she can be when cutting loose in this fashion.\n",

      "News:  CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming 11 years after his first movie and 18 after his introduction in the “Shrek” franchise, “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” brings a playful quality to the animated feline as well as a deeper message. When it comes to long-delayed sequels it’s wise to be careful what you wish for, but overall the film manages to nimbly land on its feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Granted, one can argue whether there was a need for another movie (probably not), but tasked with doing so, it’s at least energetic and mildly fun. Once again drawing heavily from storybook lore, the premise involves the fearless hero (again voiced by Antonio Banderas) having exhausted eight of his nine lives (“I am not really a math guy,” he says when apprised of the situation), which might suggest dialing it back on the dangerous swashbuckling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Undaunted, Puss confronts a scary wolf (“Narcos’” Wagner Moura) who sends him into retreat, putting him on a quest to locate the Wishing Star, whose power will grant him the ability to reclaim his lost lives and, theoretically, his bravado and mojo.\n",
      "\n",
      "In between, Puss gets a taste of what it’s like to be a rescue cat, complete with the indignities of communal feeding and litter boxes. For cat fanciers, these scenes will carry an extra comedic punch, even if they drag on a bit too long before getting around to the larger plot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along the way, Puss reunites with his love interest Kittie Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault), with whom, as it turns out, things ended badly; and picks up a nameless dog they call Perrito (Harvey Guillén of “What We Do in the Shadows”) who thinks everything is just swell, no matter how dire circumstances might appear.\n",

      "Aside from keeping the wolf at bay, Puss faces some serious competition for the Star, including Goldilocks (Florence Pugh), whose relationship with the three bears took another unexpected turn in this telling; and Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney), who has outgrown his “good boy” days and become ruthless when it comes to getting what he wants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Directed by Joel Crawford with co-director Januel Mercado (who worked together on “The Croods: A New Age”) from a screenplay by Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow, “The Last Wish” perhaps inevitably feels a little too chaotic in places, what with all the interested parties plucked from fairy tales participating in the hunt, each with their own motives. Yet there’s a sweetness to its underlying point about making the most of the life (or lives) you have, even without the cat-like cushion when it comes to cheating death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Animation, of course, allows the key characters to pick up right where they left off, although the long lag time between movies feels like a tacit admission that Puss in Boots was always better suited to the role of comedic co-star and might be a trifle thin when thrust into the central spotlight.\n",

The new film is filled with song and dance built around a(nother) fresh take on the classic “A Christmas Carol” tale, and it still manages to showcase Reynolds’s trademark smart-aleck delivery as well as Ferrell’s zaniness.

While it might be just a touch more heavy on the heartstrings, “Last Christmas” also stars Emma Thompson (who co-wrote the script) and this year’s awards darling Michelle Yeoh of “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” Plus, it features music from the late and great George Michael (the title of the movie is not an accident).\n",

What’s more, “8-Bit” features Neil Patrick Harris of “Doogie Howser” fame – a walking piece of nostalgia himself.

Between Roy and Keeley’s bonkers quest to freshen the breath of a little girl to Rebecca’s lovely gesture towards Ted, the episode is winsome, warm, sweet, and unmistakably British – just like Hugh Grant.\n"

      "New York CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be a new year. But for investors, consumers and the Federal Reserve, inflation remains a major economic concern, just as it was in 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that in mind, Wall Street will intensely scrutinize the December Consumer Price Index data for December that is set to be released Thursday. The hope is that the pace of price increases will continue to slow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consumer prices rose 7.1% year over year through November. That is still a historically high increase, but it’s a notable drop from the peak price increases of 9.1% back in June. It was also the smallest gain since December 2021’s 7% annual jump in prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hope is that inflation pressures will cool even more dramatically as the year progresses. It’s probably a pipe dream to expect that price increases will fall anytime soon to the 2% to 3% annual level that the Fed would feel most comfortable with. But as long as CPI keeps falling, the market will probably cheer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Inflation will continue to roll over. We believe inflation peaked in June,” said Nancy Tengler, CEO and chief investment officer with Laffer Tengler Investments, in a report.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tengler added that “the rise and fall of inflation is mostly symmetrical. It took 16 months to peak and now we expect it will take a like amount of time to get to a tolerable level.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Any further slowdown in the pace of inflation would be good news for average Americans but also for Corporate America. That’s because profits should get a boost as commodities expenses ease.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With a year of higher inflation under their belts, we expect the headwinds of inflationary pressures to become tailwinds as companies start to see deflation in input costs. Margins are likely to hold up better than the overall market expects,” said Brett Ewing, chief market strategist with First Franklin, in a report.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inflation impact on the Fed and housing\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s more, lower levels of inflation should allow the Fed to keep slowing its pace of interest rate hikes. Traders are hoping for just a quarter-point increase from the Fed next month … and are betting that the Fed will eventually stop hiking rates later this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Growing expectations for a Fed pause have boosted the chances that the US economy may be able to avoid a deep and prolonged recession. Many experts still think that a brief and shallow downturn is likely. But that will depend on just how aggressive the Fed decides to be with rate hikes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Fed could blink and acquiesce to a 3% to 4% inflation rate ‘for the time being,’ in which a soft landing might be possible,” said Bob Doll, chief investment officer of Crossmark Global Investments, in a report.\n",
      "\n",
      "That would also be welcome news for people still looking to buy a home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worries about rising mortgage rates (along with sky-high housing prices in many markets) have raised fears of another residential real estate crash like the one in the late-2000’s. But if inflation pressures continue to abate – and the Fed acknowledges that by pulling back on rate hikes – then the housing market may rebound.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The mortgage market is already pricing in another two (or so) rounds of rate hikes as inflation moderates,” said Phillip Wool, managing director and head of investment solutions with Rayliant, an asset management firm, in a report.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As uncertainty declines from current highs, the corresponding risk … should dissipate, bringing mortgage rates down and marginally improving affordability,” Wool added, arguing that “we simply don’t see a crash” in housing ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Get ready for big bank earnings\n",
      "\n",
      "Avoiding a worst-case scenario in housing would be particularly good news for banks. Several of the nation’s top lenders are set to report their fourth-quarter earnings on Friday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due out: Results from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and BNY Mellon. (BK) Investors will be eager to see how the mortgage businesses at these banks are holding up in light of the gigantic spike in rates last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The market will also be listening for any signs of optimism from bank CEOs about housing and the broader economy. Gloomy comments from JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon spooked traders last month.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bank stocks, like most of the rest of the market, fared miserably in 2022. Higher rates dented demand for loans. But the big banks were also hurt by a slowdown in merger activity and initial public offerings. The dearth of deals led to a drop in lucrative investment banking fees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The volatility on Wall Street was also a major problem for the asset management units of the top financial firms. iShares ETF owner BlackRock (BLK), which will also report its latest numbers on Friday, was hit particularly hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "BlackRock had more than $10 trillion in assets under management at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, a record level. Because of market turmoil of last year, that number slid to less than $8 trillion by the third quarter of 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the market rebound in the fourth quarter – the S&P 500 gained 7% in the final three months of the year thanks to a torrid October and November for stocks – Wall Street will be looking to see if more investors plowed money into BlackRock’s passive index funds at the end of 2022.\n",

      "Title:  Emmanuel Macron presses ahead with pension reform as French discontent swells\n",
      "News:  Reuters —\n",
      "\n",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron’s government will attempt to revive his economic reform drive and score a major political victory this week with a launch of the pension system’s overhaul in the face of vehement trade union opposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne is to detail on Tuesday plans to make the French work longer, most likely by raising the retirement age to 64 or 65 from 62 currently.\n",
      "\n",
      "With one of the lowest retirement ages in the industrialized world, France also spends more than most other countries on pensions at nearly 14% of economic output, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reform’s passage through parliament will not be easy. Macron lacks a working majority and will need to win over several dozen conservative lawmakers or use his constitutional powers to bypass the assembly, which would enrage the opposition and further aggravate the public.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pension reform in France, where the right to retire on a full pension at 62 is deeply cherished, is always a highly sensitive issue and even more so now with social discontent mounting over the surging cost of living.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government says reform is necessary to keep the pension system’s finances out of the red in the coming years, but a success could also be a political game-changer for Macron after he lost control of parliament last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The aim is to balance the accounts without raising taxes or cutting pensions. Various options are on the table, but all include raising the retirement age,” government spokesman Olivier Veran told journalists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hundreds of yellow vests took to the streets of Toulouse, France, on Saturday to protest against Macron's reforms, such as the planned pension reform and the unemployment reforms. Alain Pitton/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n",

      "Macron had to put the pension reform on ice in 2020 as the government rushed to contain the Covid outbreak and save the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, he can count on tougher union opposition than in 2020 with even the reform-minded CFDT – France’s biggest union – threatening to protest, which it abstained from three years ago despite misgivings about the reform at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If the retirement age is pushed back to 65 or 64, the CFDT will do what we’ve said we’ll do, we will resist this reform by calling on workers to mobilise,” CFDT head Laurent Berger said last week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Calls for walk-outs could find more traction this time with frustrations already running high over the loss of purchasing power during the current inflation crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Desperate to keep social tensions in check, the government has spent tens of billions of euros to soften the blow of record power and gas prices, which has kept French inflation lower than in most other EU countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although recent strike action has been limited to specific sectors, such as refineries and airlines, outrage over pension reform could easily spark far broader protests.\n",

      "Title:  LinkedIn is having a moment thanks to a wave of layoffs\n",
      "News:  New York CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "In a normal year at this time, a typical LinkedIn feed might be full of posts about year-end reflections on leadership and professional goals and suggested lifehacks for the year ahead — possibly with a few posts from CMOs offering tips on brand strategy, for good measure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those posts are still there. But mixed in are many others about job hunts, offers of support for laid off friends and colleagues, and advice for coping with career hurdles in an uncertain economic environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some LinkedIn users affected by recent layoffs have formed groups on the site aimed at providing assistance, coordinating around signing exit paperwork and aiding with connections for new jobs. One LinkedIn group of employees affected by the November layoffs at Facebook-parent Meta, for example, now has more than 200 members. Even bosses who are doing the laying off have turned to LinkedIn to explain themselves and seek support or advice, as one marketing CEO did in a post alongside a tearful selfie last year (to mixed results).\n",
      "\n",
      "If the first year of the pandemic was marked by widespread layoffs in lower paying retail and services jobs, the past few months have been defined by something different: the prospect of a white-collar recession. Even as the overall job market remains strong, there has been a wave of recent layoffs in the tech and media industries — which just so happen to make up a core part of LinkedIn’s user base. Suddenly, the normally staid professional network has become both a vital lifeline for recently laid off workers and a surprisingly lively social platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "The LinkedIn mobile app was downloaded an estimated 58.4 million times worldwide in 2022 across the Google Play and Apple app stores, up 10% from the prior year, according to research firm Sensor Tower.\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of posts on LinkedIn mentioning “open to work” were up 22% during November compared to the same period in the prior year, according to data provided by the company. LinkedIn says it also saw a steady increase in the rate of users adding connections last year compared to the year prior, a sign that users were more active on the platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "The uptick in use appears to have been good for LinkedIn’s business. The platform posted 17% year-over-year revenue growth in the three months ended in September, according to parent company Microsoft’s most recent earnings report. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts in the October earnings call that LinkedIn was seeing “record engagement” among its 875 million members, with growth accelerating especially in international markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of LinkedIn’s momentum may predate the wave of layoffs. “There’s been an uptick in [LinkedIn use] since the pandemic,” said Jennifer Grygiel, an associate professor and social media expert at Syracuse University. “You had to do social distancing and we were quarantining and people were working remotely so there was a shift in real-life networking possibilities.”\n",
      "\n",
      "LinkedIn rose to the occasion — and now it may be rising to another one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Layoffs and upheaval in social media industry\n",
      "\n",
      "Even apart from the layoffs, the social media landscape has been through a volatile year. Facebook and Instagram have been criticized by users for racing to turn their services into TikTok. TikTok has been criticized over concerns that user data could end up in the hands of the Chinese government. And after Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter late last year, the platform has been criticized for morphing into a possible haven for its most incendiary users.\n",
      "\n",
      "But LinkedIn remains, as ever, LinkedIn — and at this moment, with fears of a looming recession and career concerns top of mind, LinkedIn may be just what the digital world needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grygiel said many people working in media or academia are likely now looking for somewhere to build and engage in professional communities other than Twitter. And while upstart Twitter alternatives like Mastodon have experienced a surge in growth, they still don’t have the same sort of network effect that comes with a legacy platform’s broad user base.\n",
      "\n",
      "LinkedIn in recent years has leaned into courting influencers who regularly post content to the site, potentially giving users more reasons to visit. And the platform has been growing its “learning” section, which provides video courses taught by various industry experts and which the company says experienced a 17% increase in hours spent as of November compared to the year prior. But lately it appears users have more than enough reason to use LinkedIn amid a wave of thousands of layoffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the clearest and most public examples of LinkedIn’s new centrality came from rival social networks like Twitter.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the wake of Twitter’s November mass layoffs — in which half the company was terminated, followed by additional firings and exits — many former and remaining employees took to LinkedIn, rather than the platform they had built, to seek support, community and new opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "One group of Twitter employees created a spreadsheet of laid-off workers from the company alongside recruiters hiring for other firms, and used LinkedIn to help facilitate sign-ups. Another pair of former Twitter employees set up a system to connect job hunters with recruitment professionals open to volunteering to provide free resume review and interview prep services, which they promoted through LinkedIn.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We completely understand how the job-hunting process can be scary and overwhelming … While we can’t guarantee where your next opportunity will be or when it will come, we can offer guidance, so you will be ready for that opportunity when it arrives,” Darnell Gilet, a former Twitter senior technical recruiter who helped coordinate the effort, said in a LinkedIn post.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gilet, who was affected by the mass layoffs at Twitter in November following Elon Musk’s takeover, told CNN last month that around 28 different recruiters and talent acquisition professionals had agreed to participate in the system, and that he himself had spoken to nearly two dozen job seekers since shortly after he was laid off to offer advice and support. He said LinkedIn seemed like the obvious place to promote the service.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Chaos creates opportunity for somebody, right?” Gilet said. “People are getting laid off and you have this recession that’s looming, the ideal place … that would have the greatest growth opportunity from that would be a platform that’s focused on careers like LinkedIn. So it makes perfect sense.”\n"

      "It may be a new year. But for investors, consumers and the Federal Reserve, inflation remains a major economic concern, just as it was in 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that in mind, Wall Street will intensely scrutinize the December Consumer Price Index data for December that is set to be released Thursday. The hope is that the pace of price increases will continue to slow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consumer prices rose 7.1% year over year through November. That is still a historically high increase, but it’s a notable drop from the peak price increases of 9.1% back in June. It was also the smallest gain since December 2021’s 7% annual jump in prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hope is that inflation pressures will cool even more dramatically as the year progresses. It’s probably a pipe dream to expect that price increases will fall anytime soon to the 2% to 3% annual level that the Fed would feel most comfortable with. But as long as CPI keeps falling, the market will probably cheer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Inflation will continue to roll over. We believe inflation peaked in June,” said Nancy Tengler, CEO and chief investment officer with Laffer Tengler Investments, in a report.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tengler added that “the rise and fall of inflation is mostly symmetrical. It took 16 months to peak and now we expect it will take a like amount of time to get to a tolerable level.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Any further slowdown in the pace of inflation would be good news for average Americans but also for Corporate America. That’s because profits should get a boost as commodities expenses ease.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With a year of higher inflation under their belts, we expect the headwinds of inflationary pressures to become tailwinds as companies start to see deflation in input costs. Margins are likely to hold up better than the overall market expects,” said Brett Ewing, chief market strategist with First Franklin, in a report.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inflation impact on the Fed and housing\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s more, lower levels of inflation should allow the Fed to keep slowing its pace of interest rate hikes. Traders are hoping for just a quarter-point increase from the Fed next month … and are betting that the Fed will eventually stop hiking rates later this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Growing expectations for a Fed pause have boosted the chances that the US economy may be able to avoid a deep and prolonged recession. Many experts still think that a brief and shallow downturn is likely. But that will depend on just how aggressive the Fed decides to be with rate hikes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Fed could blink and acquiesce to a 3% to 4% inflation rate ‘for the time being,’ in which a soft landing might be possible,” said Bob Doll, chief investment officer of Crossmark Global Investments, in a report.\n",
      "\n",
      "That would also be welcome news for people still looking to buy a home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worries about rising mortgage rates (along with sky-high housing prices in many markets) have raised fears of another residential real estate crash like the one in the late-2000’s. But if inflation pressures continue to abate – and the Fed acknowledges that by pulling back on rate hikes – then the housing market may rebound.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The mortgage market is already pricing in another two (or so) rounds of rate hikes as inflation moderates,” said Phillip Wool, managing director and head of investment solutions with Rayliant, an asset management firm, in a report.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As uncertainty declines from current highs, the corresponding risk … should dissipate, bringing mortgage rates down and marginally improving affordability,” Wool added, arguing that “we simply don’t see a crash” in housing ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Get ready for big bank earnings\n",
      "\n",
      "Avoiding a worst-case scenario in housing would be particularly good news for banks. Several of the nation’s top lenders are set to report their fourth-quarter earnings on Friday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due out: Results from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and BNY Mellon. (BK) Investors will be eager to see how the mortgage businesses at these banks are holding up in light of the gigantic spike in rates last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The market will also be listening for any signs of optimism from bank CEOs about housing and the broader economy. Gloomy comments from JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon spooked traders last month.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bank stocks, like most of the rest of the market, fared miserably in 2022. Higher rates dented demand for loans. But the big banks were also hurt by a slowdown in merger activity and initial public offerings. The dearth of deals led to a drop in lucrative investment banking fees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The volatility on Wall Street was also a major problem for the asset management units of the top financial firms. iShares ETF owner BlackRock (BLK), which will also report its latest numbers on Friday, was hit particularly hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "BlackRock had more than $10 trillion in assets under management at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, a record level. Because of market turmoil of last year, that number slid to less than $8 trillion by the third quarter of 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the market rebound in the fourth quarter – the S&P 500 gained 7% in the final three months of the year thanks to a torrid October and November for stocks – Wall Street will be looking to see if more investors plowed money into BlackRock’s passive index funds at the end of 2022.\n",

      "News:  Hong Kong CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "In the years before Covid, China was the world’s most important source of international travelers. Its 155 million tourists spent more than a quarter of a trillion dollars beyond its borders in 2019.\n",
      "\n",
      "That largesse fell precipitously over the past three years as the country essentially closed its borders. But, as China prepares to reopen on Sunday, millions of tourists are poised to return to the world stage, raising hopes of a rebound for the global hospitality industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although international travel may not return immediately to pre-pandemic levels, companies, industries and countries that rely on Chinese tourists will get a boost in 2023, according to analysts.\n",
      "\n",
      "China averaged about 12 million outbound air passengers per month in 2019, but those numbers fell 95% during the Covid years, according to Steve Saxon, a partner in McKinsey’s Shenzhen office. He predicts that figure will recover to about 6 million per month by the summer, driven by the pent-up wanderlust of young, wealthy Chinese like Emmy Lu, who works for an advertising company in Beijing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m so happy [about the reopening]! ” Lu told CNN. “Because of the pandemic, I could only wander around the country for the past years. It was difficult.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s just that I’ve been stuck inside the country for a little too long. I’m really looking forward to the lifting of the restrictions, so that I can go somewhere for fun! ” the 30-year-old said, adding that she wanted to visit Japan and Europe the most.\n",
      "\n",
      "A traveler at the Beijing Capital International Airport on Friday, Dec. 30, 2022. Stringer/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n",
      "\n",
      "As China announced last month it would no longer subject inbound travelers to quarantine starting January 8, including residents returning from trips abroad, searches for international flights and accommodations immediately hit a three-year high on Trip.com (TCOM).\n",
      "\n",
      "Bookings for overseas travel during the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday, which falls between January 21 and January 27 this year, have soared by 540% from a year ago, according to data from the Chinese travel site. Average spending per booking jumped 32%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The top destinations are in the Asia Pacific region, including Australia, Thailand, Japan and Hong Kong. The United States and the United Kingdom also ranked among the top 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The rapid buildup in … [bank] deposits over the past year suggests that households in China have accumulated significant cash holdings,” said Alex Loo, a macro strategist for TD Securities, adding that frequent lockdowns have likely led to restraints on household spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "There could be “revenge spending” by Chinese consumers, mirroring what happened in many developed markets when they reopened early last year, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who benefits?\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s good news for many economies battered by the pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We estimate that Hong Kong, Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore would benefit the most if China’s travel service imports were to return to 2019 levels,” said Goldman Sachs analysts。\n",
      "\n",
      "Hong Kong — the world’s most visited city with just under 56 million arrivals in 2019, most of them from mainland China — could see an estimated 7.6% boost to its GDP as exports and tourism income increase, they said. Thailand’s GDP may be boosted by 2.9%, while Singapore would get a lift of 1.2%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elsewhere in the world, Cambodia, Mauritius, Malaysia, Taiwan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, South Korea and Philippines are also likely to benefit from the return of Chinese tourists, according to research by Capital Economics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hong Kong has suffered particularly acutely from the closure of its border with mainland China. The city’s pillar industries of tourism and real estate have been hit hard. The financial hub expects GDP to have contracted by 3.2% in 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "The city government announced Thursday that up to 60,000 people would be allowed to cross the border daily each way, starting Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several other Southeast Asian countries reliant on tourism have kept entry rules relatively relaxed for Chinese tourists, despite the record Covid-19 outbreak that has swept through China in recent weeks. They include Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore and the Philippines.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is one of the opportunities that we can accelerate economic recovery,” Thailand’s health minister said this week.\n",
      "\n",
      "New Zealand has also waived testing requirements for Chinese visitors, who were the second largest source of tourist revenue for the country before the pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who wants testing?\n",
      "\n",
      "But other governments are more cautious. So far, nearly a dozen countries, including the United States, Germany, France, Canada, Japan, Australia and South Korea, have mandated testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The European Union on Wednesday “strongly encouraged” its members states to require a negative Covid test for visitors from China before arrival.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is clearly “conflict” between the tourism authorities and the political and health officials in some countries, said Saxon, who leads McKinsey’s travel practice in Asia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Airlines and airports have already blasted the EU’s recommendations for testing requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "The International Air Transport Association, the airline industry’s global lobby group, together with airports represented by ACI Europe as well as Airlines for Europe, issued a joint statement on Thursday, calling the EU move “regrettable” and “a knee-jerk reaction.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But they welcomed the additional recommendation to test wastewater as a way of identifying new variants of the disease, saying it should be an alternative to testing passengers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Full recovery?\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides restrictions, it will take time for international travel to fully rebound because many Chinese must renew their passports and apply for visas again, according to analysts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lu from Beijing said she was still considering her travel plans, taking into consideration the various testing requirements and the high price of flying.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The restrictions are normal, because everyone wants to protect people in their own country,” she said. “I’ll wait and see if some policies will be eased.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Liu Chaonan, a 24-year-old in Shenzhen, said she had initially wanted to go to the Philippines to celebrate the Chinese New Year, but didn’t have time to apply for the visa. So she switched to Thailand, which offers quick and easy electronic permits.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Time is short and I need to leave in about 10 days. People may choose some visa-friendly places and countries to travel to,” she said, adding that she plans to learn scuba diving and wants to buy cosmetics. Her total budget for the trip could exceed 10,000 yuan ($1,460).\n",
      "\n",
      "Saxon said he expected China’s outbound international travel to fully recover by the year end.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Generally, individuals are pragmatic and countries will welcome Chinese tourists due to their spending power,” he said, adding that countries may remove restrictions quickly when the Covid situation improves in China.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It will take time for international tourism to get going, but it will come rushing back, when it happens.”\n"

      "News:  CNN —\n",

      "Chinese billionaire Jack Ma will no longer control Ant Group after the fintech giant’s shareholders agreed to reshape its shareholding structure, according to a statement released by the company on Saturday.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the adjustment, Ma’s voting rights will fall to 6.2%, according to the statement and CNN calculations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the restructure, Ma possessed more than 50% of voting rights at Ant via Hangzhou Yunbo and two other entities, according to its IPO prospectus filed with the exchanges in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ant added in the statement that the voting rights adjustment, a move to make the company’s shareholder structure “more transparent and diversified,” will not result in any change to the economic interests of any shareholders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ant said its 10 major shareholders, including Ma, had agreed to no longer act in concert when exercising their voting rights, and would only vote independently, and thus no shareholder would have “sole or joint control over Ant Group.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The voting rights overhaul came after Chinese regulators pulled the plug on Ant’s $37 billion IPO in November 2020, and ordered the company to restructure its business.\n",

      "\n",
      "Macy’s said Friday its net sales from the holiday quarter will likely be at the low-end to mid-point of its previously issued range of $8.16 billion to $8.4 billion. The retailer said its adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be between $1.47 to $1.67.\n",

      "“Overall, our occasion apparel and gift-giving business were strengths, and inventory composition and price points aligned with customers’ needs,” Gennette said, noting that its high-end Bloomingdale’s stores and cosmetics line Bluemercury continued to outperform forecasts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Macy’s warning may provide an early clue to investors wondering if high inflation has hampered shopping demand during the holidays.\n",

      "Americans spent more this season to keep up with high prices. US retail sales increased 7.6% during the period between November 1 to December 24 compared to the same time last year, according to the Mastercard Spending Pulse.

      "News:  CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the pandemic, major retailers have warned about surging theft and a rise in brazen shoplifting attempts. But a top Walgreens executive now says the freakout may have been overblown.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Maybe we cried too much last year” about merchandise losses, Walgreens finance chief James Kehoe acknowledged Thursday on an earnings call. The company’s rate of shrink — merchandise losses due to theft, fraud, damages, mis-scanned items and other errors — fell from 3.5% of total sales last year to around 2.5% during its latest quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kehoe’s message is a notable shift from comments about theft from Walgreens and other retailers like Walmart and Target over the last nearly three years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Companies and retail industry groups have tried to draw attention to shoplifting and “organized retail crime” rings smashing windows and grabbing aisles full of merchandise off shelves, urging lawmakers to crack down. Incidents have certainly happened: Many political leaders and local and national news outlets, including CNN, have picked up on viral incidents of smash-and-grab robberies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Walgreens says it may have gone too far on security. Jeff Greenberg/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n",
      "\n",
      "So retailers took action. Some began locking up more products like deodorant and toothpaste, adding extra security guards and even shuttering stores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last January, Walgreens (WBA) said its shrink was up by more 50% from the year prior. The company blamed part of that spike on organized retail crime and closed five locations in the San Francisco area in 2021, claiming theft as the reason for their closure.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is not petty theft,” Kehoe said last January. “These are gangs that actually go in and empty our stores of beauty products. And it’s a real issue.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But a year later, Kehoe said Thursday that the company added too much extra security in stores.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Probably we put in too much, and we might step back a little bit from that,” he said of security staffing. The company has found private security guards to be “largely ineffective” in deterring theft, so instead it’s putting in more police and law enforcement officers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The numbers used didn’t add up\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Walgreens may have overblown the shoplifting threat over the last few years, it’s true that theft has always been a problem for retailers — and that it often spikes during recessions and other periods of economic hardship, when people are desperate and may feel the need to turn to petty crime to sustain themselves. What’s more, recent factors like shortstaffed stores and self-checkout can make it easier for thieves to steal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The National Retail Federation estimated that shrink cost retailers $94.5 billion in 2021, up from $61.7 billion in 2019 before the pandemic. Shoplifting often does not go reported to the police, but companies have said theft has worsened during the Covid crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Along with other retailers, we’ve seen a significant increase in theft and organized retail crime across our business,” Target (TGT) CEO Brian Cornell said in November.\n",
      "\n",
      "Walmart (WMT) CEO Doug McMillon said last month on CNBC that “theft is an issue” and “higher than what it has historically been.” He warned stores could close if it continued.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it’s not clear the numbers add up.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, data released by the San Francisco Police Department does not support the explanation Walgreens gave that it was closing five stores because of organized retail theft, the San Francisco Chronicle reported in 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the shuttered stores that closed had only seven reported shoplifting incidents in 2021 and a total of 23 since 2018, according to the newspaper. Overall, the five stores that closed had fewer than two recorded shoplifting incidents a month on average since 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, a 2021 Los Angeles Times analysis of figures released by industry groups on losses due to organized retail crime found “there is reason to doubt the problem is anywhere near as large or widespread as they say.”\n"

      "A bankruptcy filing, which reportedly could come in a matter of weeks, might spell the end of its iconic coupon programs, especially if the company pursues a bankruptcy process that involves liquidation rather than just restructuring.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If Bed Bath & Beyond files for bankruptcy, the retailer might honor the 20% coupons for a 30-day period. After that, and especially if it starts closing stores and sets liquidation sales, creditors wouldn’t want to allow shoppers to tack on those 20% off coupons on top of 70% off liquidation prices,” said Burt Flickinger, retail expert and managing director of retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other retailers have followed a similar game plan after bankruptcy and store closings.\n",

      "Toys ‘R’ Us honored its gift cards, store credit and coupons for a 30-day period after it filed for bankruptcy in 2017, and subsequently liquidated its US business. The toy seller has since begun to attempt a comeback through a partnership with Macy’s, and opened its first post-bankruptcy store in 2019 under new ownership.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not just creditors who might take issue with the store honoring the coupons on top of liquidation discounts. “For suppliers of name brands in particular, they wouldn’t want the deep discounting to negatively impact their brand image,” said Ali Besharat, associate professor of marketing and co-director of the Consumer Insights and Business Innovation Center at the University of Denver’s Daniels College of Business.\n",

      "\n",
      "Over time, the oversized postcard-like mailer and digital coupon with an eye-popping purple-blue border and font blaring “20% off in-store or online” developed a cult following and became a successful marketing strategy to lure in repeat shoppers, said Flickinger.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Bed Bath & Beyond coupon is seen on January 6, 2023. Austin Steele/CNN\n",

      "\n",
      "Rumors swirled on various social platforms that Big Blue coupons never expire, even though the weekly coupon does feature an expiration date.\n",

      "Then the pandemic hit and walloped the retail industry. With stores closed for months, and consumers rethinking their non-essential purchases, Bed Bath & Beyond sales and profit took a hit. In late 2020, the retailer said it was scaling back on its popular coupon program to boost its business.\n",

      "\n",
      "We’re in the salad days of the New Year — that period where many feel refreshed and motivated and perhaps even optimistic about the year to come. There’s a certain clarity that comes during this time in January.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, the big question weighing on everyone’s mind is whether or not the United States will enter a recession this year. And there are three big “ifs” that will determine the health of the economy: The strength of the labor market, the American consumer and the Federal Reserve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will the labor market cool off?\n",
      "\n",
      "Jobs has been the word of the week as investors eye a slew of data highlighting a strong labor market that is confoundingly resistant to the Fed’s attempts to cool the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The US labor market is historically tight, with the unemployment rate, as of November, at just 3.7% and about 1.7 available jobs for every job seeker. If job numbers come in as expected on Friday, 2022 will be the second-best year on record for job growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is all happening as the Fed tries to actively cool the labor market. Policymakers fear that persistent wage growth in a tight labor market will keep already sky-high inflation levels elevated.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the Fed to reach its desired target of 2% inflation, jobs will have to take a hit, with unemployment rising to about 4.6% this year, according to the central bank’s projections released in December. The central bank will likely continue to put pressure on the economy by instituting painful rate hikes until we get there.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an interview with the Financial Times this week, Gita Gopinath, second in command at the International Monetary Fund, urged the Fed to continue with rate increases this year, citing the labor market’s resilience.\n",
      "\n",
      "So will wages moderate this year? Analysts at Goldman Sachs predict that they will. They believe that unemployment will grow and wage growth will slow from above 5% in 2022 to about 4% by the end of this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This would still be a bit too hot, but any sizeable drop would provide Fed officials with a proof of concept for the idea that gradual labor market rebalancing can dampen wage and eventually price pressures without a recession,” they write.\n",
      "\n",
      "If 2022 taught investors anything, it’s that you can’t beat the Fed. So expect more good-is-bad economic news, since a strong monthly jobs report will likely continue to correlate to a weak market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will Americans continue to spend?\n",
      "\n",
      "American consumers carried the weight of the economy on their backs last year. Even as interest rates rose and growth weakened, they kept on shopping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan told CNN around the holidays that the continued strength of the US consumer is nearly single-handedly staving off recession.\n",
      "\n",
      "But weaker-than-expected retail sales in November pummeled market sentiment last month and raised the odds that the Fed’s punishing interest rate hikes would push the economy into recession.\n",
      "\n",
      "US retail sales fell 0.6% in November, the weakest performance in nearly a year. Weak sales are likely to continue, say analysts, and if they do, retailers’ earnings will suffer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disposable income fell from the spring of 2021 through the summer of 2022 as inflation outran wage growth and pandemic savings dried up. While American bank accounts are still fairly robust, consumers are borrowing more. In the third quarter of 2022, credit card balances jumped 15% year over year. That’s the largest annual jump since the New York Fed began tracking the data in 2004.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will the Fed pivot?\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the main question on every investor’s mind — and the answer will not only help determine what happens to markets this year, but also whether the economy will fall into recession.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the minutes from the December Fed meeting, central bank officials spelled it out for interested parties: No policy makers anticipated that rate cuts would be appropriate in 2023. The minutes warned that “an unwarranted easing in financial conditions … would complicate the Committee’s effort to restore price stability.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And while officials welcomed softer inflation reports in recent months, they stressed that “substantially more evidence of progress” was required and said that inflation was still “unacceptably high.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So while rate cuts may be off the table this year, the Fed could opt for more modest increases, or even none at all as the year progresses. That would be welcome relief to investors after four hikes of three-quarters of a point last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mortgage rates continue to soar\n",
      "\n",
      "Mortgage rates rose again last week, beginning 2023 twice as high as they were a year ago. The hike also reverses six straight weeks of falling rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.48% in the week ending January 5, up from 6.42% the week before, according to Freddie Mac. A year ago, the 30-year fixed rate was 3.22%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mortgage rates rose throughout most of 2022, spurred by the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented campaign of harsh interest rate hikes to tame soaring inflation. But mortgage rates dropped in November and December, following data that showed inflation may have finally reached its peak, reports my colleague Anna Bahney.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current market is driving away would-be buyers, partially because there’s little inventory as Americans are uninterested in selling and parting ways with their ultra-low mortgage rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, this week’s drive upwards could be a fluke and as inflation begins to ease, rates are expected to also drop.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mortgage application activity sunk to a quarter-century low this week as high mortgage rates continue to weaken the housing market,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist. “While mortgage market activity has significantly shrunk over the last year, inflationary pressures are easing and should lead to lower mortgage rates in 2023.”\n",

      "\n",
      "The operator became the early face of the telephone, a human behind an emerging and complex technology. The job came to be occupied mostly by single, middle-class White women, often known as “Hello Girls.” The Bell System, known as Ma Bell, advertised its mostly female ranks of operators as servile and attentive – “The Voice with a Smile” – to attract and maintain customers.\n",

      "To connect a call, an operator at a switching office would take a request from a caller and physically plug one line into another.\n",

      "By early part of the twentieth century, telephone companies began to separate requests for information and requests for telephone numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1968, the Bell System changed the name of its information service to “directory assistance” because too many people were taking the name too literally.\n",

      "“When she was called ‘Information,’ people kept calling her for the wrong reasons,” one Bell company ad said at the time. “Now we call her ‘Directory Assistance’ in the hope that you’ll call her only for numbers you can’t find in the phone book.”\n",

      "The growth of automatic switchboards led to the direct-dial telephone in the 1920s. (The “0” for operator appeared with dial phones, said Lauer from the University of New Hampshire. On the new Bell dials, “Operator” was printed in the “0” position. The use of “411” also emerged with the dial era. “0” became universal for operator assistance and “411” was the number for directory assistance. In later years, if you dialed “0 and asked for directory assistance, the operator would transfer you over to “411.”)\n",

      "\n",
      "Monday was the final day for many leagues, and with the NFL deciding to not to replay Monday’s Bengals-Bills game, an issue arises in how to declare a winner. Some leagues have decided to forgo determining champions and instead donate their pots to Hamlin’s charity via GoFundMe.\n",

      "\n",
      "The model considers factors, such as players’ correlation, variance and favored odds to determine probability-based winners and losers. Released Wednesday, the calculator may help clear up some of the confusion fantasy leagues face as players struggle to determine winners without points from Monday night’s game.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At this point, it’s pretty much set. Everything had already played except for the Monday night game, so it was just the players on Buffalo and Cincinnati, and there’s some good players there,” Braun told CNN. “So it wasn’t really decision making, it’s more of just ‘what was your actual odds of winning?’ and then piping that into a calculation on how much you get if you won and how much you get if you lost.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The calculator had 15,000 site visitors in its first day as fantasy league members across the country try to crown a winner after an abrupt, unexpected season end.\n"

      "\n",
      "The change in sentiment comes after Jack Ma’s Ant Group won a key approval for capital expansion of its consumer finance unit. Ant Group is a fintech affiliate of Alibaba, both of which were founded by Ma.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Approval for Ant Group to expand its consumer finance business marked another positive step in easing regulatory risks,” said Yeap Jun Rong, a market analyst at IG Group.\n",

      "News:  London CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "Natural gas prices in Europe and the United States have tumbled to levels last seen before Russia sparked a global energy crisis by invading Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wholesale European gas prices, as measured by the benchmark Dutch futures contract, have dropped almost 48% since mid-December to trade at €71 ($74) per megawatt hour on Friday — roughly where they stood on February 15 last year, a little over a week before Moscow’s unprovoked assault on its neighbor. Prices are now nearly 80% below their all-time August high of €346 ($364) per megawatt hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the United States, the cost of wholesale gas flowing through the Henry Hub pipeline — which serves as the country’s price benchmark — has dropped 50% to $3.68 per million British thermal units (Mbtu) since late November, back to around levels last seen in December 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a period of extreme cold that swept the United States last month, the return of warmer weather in January has helped rebalance gas stores, pushing prices lower, Massimo Di Odoardo, vice president of gas and LNG research at Wood Mackenzie, told CNN.\n",
      "\n",
      "Europe can also thank a record-breaking spell of warm weather, as well as its own barnstorming effort last summer to fill gas storage, despite a slump in imports from Russia, its biggest supplier before the war.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s no panic any more,” Henning Gloystein, director of energy, climate and resources at Eurasia Group, told CNN, referring to fears swirling last year that Europe could be forced to ration gas over the winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s encouraging news for the millions of households and businesses across the continent who have struggled to pay their soaring energy bills. But they shouldn’t expect immediate relief, analysts told CNN.\n",
      "\n",
      "Falling energy prices have helped bring down inflation. Across the 19 countries that share the euro currency, consumer price inflation dropped to 9.2% in December from 10.1% the month before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so, European gas prices are still historically high, and could rise again this year if demand from China picks up or supplies are disrupted. It will also take some time for lower wholesale prices to feed through to consumers’ bills, given that some countries have either fixed or capped current prices for the next few months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the region is in “a much better position compared to what people feared only a couple of months ago,” Di Odoardo said.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Gas Infrastructure Europe, the continent’s storage facilities are currently 83% full. That’s well above the 69% the EU averaged at this point in the five years to 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "Demand is down\n",
      "\n",
      "Efforts by European households and businesses to use less gas — encouraged by the voluntary 15% reduction target set by the EU — have helped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Di Odoardo estimated that residential demand for gas dropped by a fifth in November. Moves by industrial consumers to switch fuels and find efficiencies have also paid off, leading to a 20% cut in demand in the latter half of 2022, compared with the same period the year before, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Europe has rapidly learned to live without Russian gas after Moscow slashed its pipeline exports last year. The bloc has boosted imports from Norway and snapped up supplies of liquefied natural gas — a chilled, liquid form of gas that can be transported via sea tankers — mostly from the United States and Qatar.\n",
      "\n",
      "The continent has also raced to build the facilities needed to receive LNG via ships and convert it into gas that can be transported through pipelines. Germany, the bloc’s biggest consumer of gas, recently opened two regasification terminals, and plans to bring another two online in the coming days, Gloystein said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, as the continent looks to fill its stores ahead of next winter with very little Russian gas, problems could arise. According to Gloystein, the task is “going to cost a lot of money” given, in part, how vulnerable the bloc is to price rises in a tight LNG market. A pipeline outage in Norway, or a drop in US exports caused by extreme weather, could feasibly trigger a price spike.\n",
      "\n",
      "A recovery in demand in China, which recently ditched its strict zero-Covid policy, could also push prices higher again, according to a Deutsche Bank analysis released last month.\n",
      "\n",
      "An ‘expensive cocktail’\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite their recent steep decline, gas prices in Europe are still more than four times higher compared to the average over the past decade, Philip Lausberg, policy analyst at the European Policy Centre, told CNN.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wholesale prices were already shooting up in the months before the war as economies reopened from pandemic lockdowns. Then, a surge in prices following Moscow’s invasion sent consumer bills soaring further and forced governments to stump up huge subsidies.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to an analysis by Bruegel, a Brussels-based think tank, European governments, including the United Kingdom, committed around €705 billion ($739 billion) between September 2021 and last November to help shield consumers from painful rises to their bills.\n",
      "\n",
      "Giovanni Sgaravatti, a research analyst at Bruegel, told CNN that it could take up to five months for consumers to see their bills come down.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It will take a bit [of time] for the fall in the wholesale prices of natural gas to [feed into] into the retail prices,” he said. “We’re not really out of the woods,” he added.\n",

      "\n",
      "That’s partly because of the way countries regulate the price of energy. Some countries, like the United Kingdom and Germany, either fix or cap prices for a set period of time, meaning consumers will be paying higher bills for longer, analysts told CNN.\n",
      "\n",
      "UK wholesale gas futures for the second quarter of this year have dropped 66% since September, according to HSBC Global Research.\n",
      "\n",
      "UK household bills could start to fall from July, if market prices fall below the government’s annual £3,000 ($3,573) cap. The country’s businesses could feel the impact of lower wholesale prices sooner, when the government withdraws its support in April.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As energy suppliers buy their gas and electricity in advance to fix some of their costs, wholesale price decreases are not immediately passed through to consumers,” Lausberg said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If the wholesale price remains low, consumers could profit from cheaper energy bills in a few months,” he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, some power companies will need to pass on the costs of the new LNG infrastructure, Gloystein said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Everything put together is a pretty expensive cocktail,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "That will keep Europe at a competitive disadvantage to the United States, where gas prices are about five times lower.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For companies that have a business model where energy represents a good chunk of their costs, they could be incentivized to move to the US,” Sgaravatti said. “So that is a bit of a worry.”\n",

      "Title:  Ram unveils electric truck concept with seats in the bed\n",
      "News:  CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "Stellantis’s Ram truck brand is behind its competitors on launching an electric pickup, with trucks from major rivals already on the market or coming soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said the company is using its time to come up with features and capabilities competitors won’t have. That may include an extra row of removable fold-away seats.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ram 1500 Revolution concept truck, unveiled Thursday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, provides an early look at several features Ram’s future electric truck could have, including a rear passenger cabin wall that folds away, leaving the truck cab fully open into the cargo bed. That is not a new idea, as General Motors’ Chevrolet and GMC electric trucks hitting the market later this year and early next will offer a folding back cab wall; the Chevrolet Avalanche gas-powered truck also offered it over a decade ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "What the Revolution concept also has, though, are “third row jump seats” that fold out from that back wall while the second row of seats can slide forward to make room. Having three rows of seats is possible because, without the need for a gas engine, the Revolution’s cab is extra-long. The seats can also be removed, said Ralph Gilles, Stellantis’s head of design, allowing them to be used outside the truck or in the cargo bed for tailgating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Designers plan to use the \"tuning fork\" light design seen inside and outside the Ram Revolution concept in production versions of the truck. Stellantis\n",
      "\n",
      "Space under the hood is available for storage and there’s a pass-through hole that can be opened through the cab and into the “frunk,” or front trunk. Thanks to that pass-through and the fold-down cab wall, a pole or board as long as 18 feet can be loaded into the truck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stellantis promises that the production version of the truck, due out in 2024, will lead the market in terms of range, towing capability, payload capacity and charging speed. While not making any specific claims for this concept truck in terms of driving range or performance, Stellantis did say the truck would be capable of charging 100 miles of range in 10 minutes. That’s fairly standard for vehicles that can work with fast chargers, but real-world charging times vary greatly depending on factors like outside temperature and the capabilities of the charger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since it’s a concept vehicle, it’s likely that not all the features displayed on this truck will be included in the production version. The concept truck has doors that open outward from the center with no pillar in the middle. While that’s a common design feature on concept vehicles – it makes the interior easier to see – it’s almost never used in production vehicles that need the structural strength provided by that pillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ram 1500 Revolution concept has two electric motors, one powering the back wheels and one for the front, giving it all-wheel-drive. It’s the most common way of providing all-wheel-drive in electric vehicles but some trucks, like the Rivian R1T, use four motors, one powering each wheel. The Ram Revolution is engineered with room for bigger, more powerful motors for high performance versions of the truck, according to Stellantis.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the back of the cab open, very long items can be loaded. Stellantis\n",
      "\n",
      "Some automakers already have electric trucks on the market, such as the Rivian R1T and Ford F-150 Lightning; others like General Motors have revealed production-ready trucks due to come to market by early 2024. Even Tesla is expected to finally start production of its Cybertruck by the end of 2023 following years of delays.\n",
      "\n",
      "The electric Ram truck won’t go on sale until some time in 2024. Stellantis promised that the production version of the Ram electric truck would be unveiled “in the coming months.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Once just a model of pickup truck produced under the Dodge brand, Ram was spun off as a separate brand in 2009. The truck line can trace its roots back to Graham Brothers Trucks, a company that began making trucks with Dodge engines and transmissions in 1921 and was later purchased by Dodge.\n",

      "News:  New York CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "Strong jobs reports, robust manufacturing data, still-hot consumer spending. Any time America reports its economy is strong, Wall Street has a freak-out.\n",
      "\n",
      "So why is good news taken as bad news on Wall Street?\n",
      "\n",
      "“The short answer is that as the economy continues to grow, particularly on the jobs front, that puts more pressure on the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates,” explains John Leer, chief economist at Morning Consult.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strong economic reports mean the Federal Reserve’s historic rate hikes may not be having the effect that they should, and Jerome Powell & Co. may need to raise rates for longer to slow the economy and cool inflation. Rate hikes are bad news for stocks because they eat into companies’ profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wall Street is particularly sensitive to strong jobs numbers. The resilience in the jobs market has been remarkable. The US economy last year created 4.5 million jobs, the second most in history, with more than 10 million job openings. The fear is that the strong jobs market (good for Main Street) will spin off more inflation (bad for companies and Wall Street.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The Goldilocks scenario for investors would be a strong job market showing signs of cooling. (Not too hot, not too cold, but just right.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Case in point: the December jobs report. December posted a strong 223,000 new jobs but it was the slowest pace since December 2020. And wages in December grew 4.6% on an annual basis, the slowest since August 2021. That may not sound like great news to you or me, but Wall Street took that reading as a sign the Fed’s medicine may be beginning to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One of the things that we’ve seen is that wage growth has been fairly strong and there’s the fear that wage growth is going to ultimately drive inflation higher,” Leer told me on CNN’s Early Start. “So the Federal Reserve wants to raise interest rates to try to curb the demand for workers and hopefully bring down wages, which in fact will then ultimately bring down inflation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s a challenging balancing act. The Fed wants to kill too-high inflation but not drive the economy into a recession.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s the latest storyline in the confusing “yes, but” economy. Yes, the economy is strong, but it means the Fed may need to deliver more medicine that will hurt later. Yes, the jobs market is strong, but showing signs of slowing. Yes, it was the second-best year in history for job-creation, but it’s not expected to last and that may be good news, because it takes some of the froth out of the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adding to economists and Wall Street’s confusion: Covid, war in Ukraine, the labor shortage, supply chain chaos…. All these problems mean we have to throw conventional economic wisdom out the window. We have no history to guide us on any of this. And there are no easy solutions.\n",

      "\n",
      "The NFL’s decision not to resume or replay Monday’s Bills-Bengals game, which was halted after Buffalo safety Damar Hamlin suffered cardiac arrest, won’t be particularly costly the world’s richest sports league.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the league announced late Thursday that the game will not be completed, the home-team Cincinnati Bengals notified fans who were in attendance that they will receive a credit for the price of their tickets and parking to be applied to their future purchases – either upcoming playoff games or their 2023 season tickets. Refunds are available for fans who would prefer a credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The average ticket price for a non-premium seat to a Bengals game is about $88, the cheapest in the NFL, according to Team Marketing Reports, which tracks ticket prices. TMR estimates that the cost of all the tickets, both regular and premium seats, for the game came to about $6.7 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although that’s not insignificant, it’s a drop in the bucket for the NFL, which had an estimated total league-wide revenue of $18 billion in the 2021-22 season, sources with knowledge of the league’s finances told CNN. The gate at the missing game comes to about 37 cents for every $1,000 of league-wide revenue last year – and the league’s sales are expected to grow this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it opted to replay or continue the postponed game, the NFL almost certainly would have needed to push back the playoffs that are set to start next weekend. That game likely would have received enormous fan interest and ratings approximating those of a playoff game or Super Bowl. But it would have posed logistical challenges for the league and its broadcast partners, which had made plans for almost a year for the upcoming playoff games.\n",
      "\n",
      "The league said it decided to skip the resumption of the game because its outcome would not have determined which teams qualified for the playoffs and which teams were eliminated, even if the outcome would have affected the seeding of the playoffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fans who bought tickets to the game on the secondary market, likely for more than the face value of the tickets, will likely have those purchases canceled by the resale service. The statement from the Bengals to fans said that’s what Ticketmaster plans to do for tickets purchased on its Ticket Exchange service. Two other major resale services, StubHub and SeatGeek, confirmed they are also canceling sales of tickets for the game, and refunding the purchase price of the tickets and fees paid by buyers.\n",
      "\n",
      "That means that ticketholders will lose the profit they might have received from selling the tickets, but those who bought the tickets won’t be hit with the difference between what they paid, and what they could get in a refund.\n"

      "News:  New York CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wall Street Journal is demanding answers from the Phoenix Police Department after an officer detained and handcuffed one of its reporters outside a Chase Bank — an incident that press freedom advocates say raises First Amendment concerns and mirrors a larger, growing hostility from local law enforcement toward journalists across the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The incident between The Journal reporter Dion Rabouin and the Phoenix officer occurred in late November, but just became public this week after ABC affiliate KNXV reported on the matter. In a statement, The Journal said that it is “deeply concerned” with how its reporter was treated and has asked the Phoenix Police Department to conduct an investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No journalist should ever be detained simply for exercising their First Amendment rights,” The Journal said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up here for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape\n",
      "\n",
      "In response, the Phoenix Police Department — which is being probed by the Department of Justice to determine whether its officers retaliate against people “for conduct protected by the First Amendment” — stressed to me that the incident occurred on private property, but that the department had nonetheless shared concerns raised by the paper with the Professional Standards Bureau andthat an investigation is underway.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the crux of this particular matter is a rather innocent act of journalism. While visiting family in Arizona for the Thanksgiving holiday, Rabouin, who is Black, attempted to interview passersby on a sidewalk outside a Chase branch for an ongoing story about savings accounts, he told the Phoenix affiliate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Representatives from the bank approached him and asked what he was doing and Rabouin said he identified himself as a journalist. Rabouin said he was never asked to leave, but an officer soon arrived on the scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rabouin said he volunteered to simply stop reporting from the scene, but video captured by a bystander shows the responding officer handcuff him, put him in the back of a police vehicle, and even threaten to shove him in if he did not comply. The video shows Rabouin repeatedly identified himself as a reporter for The Journal, but the officer did not appear to care. The bystander who began recording the incident was also threatened with arrest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, after about 15 minutes, when other officers showed up, Rabouin was allowed to walk free. A representative for Chase told me Thursday that the bank did apologize to Rabouin over the incident. But the local police department has thus far refrained from doing so.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a letter dated December 7 from Journal Editor-In-Chief Matt Murray to Phoenix Police Department Interim Chief Michael Sullivan, the editor described the officer’s conduct as “offensive to civil liberties,” and demanded to know what steps the department will take to “ensure that neither Mr. Rabouin nor any other journalist is again subjected to such conduct.” The Journal told me Thursday that Murray has not received a response from Sullivan.\n",
      "\n",
      "For press freedom advocates, the incident is representative of countless others that take place around the US each year. According to the US Press Freedom Tracker, at least 218 journalists have been arrested in the country since 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bruce Brown, the executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, told me in a statement that “the alarming number of incidents we’ve seen over the last several years where police have detained, arrested, or assaulted journalists who were doing their jobs threatens to chill this kind of essential newsgathering.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Brown added, “It’s time for the law enforcement community to hold itself accountable for its actions. The Phoenix Police Department can start now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Committee to Protect Journalists has also sounded the alarm over the incident. Katherine Jacobsen, the organization’s US and Canada program director, told me the detention of Rabouin “highlights a very real threat faced by reporters – especially local reporters – across the country.” Jacobsen went on to say that it is “disheartening to see acts of hostility toward journalists working in the United States.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Through a spokesperson, Rabouin declined to comment to me on Thursday. But he did post one tweet about the matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thanks to everyone who has reached out to offer support,” Rabouin wrote. “We’re hoping to hear back from the chief or someone at the department soon.”\n",

      "\n",
      "There were still about 1.7 job openings for each job seeker in November, unchanged from October, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Federal Reserve closely monitors this ratio, since tightness in the labor market means employees have greater leverage to seek higher wages, which in turn drives up inflation.\n",

      "\n",
      "Job hiring inched down to 6.06 million in November from 6.11 million in October, according to the report. Layoffs fell to 1.35 million from 1.45 million, and the number of people quitting their job increased to 4.17 million from 4.05 million.\n",

This report moves us from cautious to cautiously optimistic. I don’t expect to have to use the word recession any time soon.”\n",

      "The commission said it had levied “one of the largest civil penalties in our history” due, in part, to the company “distributing recalled products with a lethal defect.” In May 2021, Peloton recalled about 125,000 of its Tread+ brand treadmills following the death of a 6-year-old child and dozens of other reports of injuries related to its machines.\n",

      "The fine, according to the commission, reflected that initial refusal. Peloton had received reports of “entrapment” by its Tread+ treadmills as early as 2018, it said.\n",

      "“Every well-diversified portfolio has winners and losers in it, but the key is taking on just enough risk to reach your financial goals,” Wilson said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ignore the noise\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether 2023 is great or awful for stocks — or, more likely, both at different times — that shouldn’t sway your investing decisions.\n",

      "“When it comes to success in investing, “It’s not about timing the market. It’s about time in the market,” Wilson noted.\n",

      "\n",
      "What a sensible portfolio might look like\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have a reasonably long time horizon but not a huge appetite for risk, a balanced portfolio of stocks to bonds might suit you well in the next year.\n",

      "Given recession concerns, Wilson noted that value stocks, which represent companies with strong fundamentals but are considered underpriced, tend to perform better during economic downturns. They typically pay a higher dividend, maintain strong earnings and have a lower price-to-earnings ratios.\n",

      "Higher-yielding bonds might also be an attractive option, Wilson said.\n",
      "\n",
      "For those with a long time horizon and a high tolerance for risk, Wilson suggests looking for buying opportunities among stocks that have been hammered. “Look for good companies that have been oversold, and avoid companies that may not have the earnings or balance sheet to survive this possible downturn.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And for those close to or in retirement, for whom preservation of assets is critical for the money needed in the next five years, he recommends creating a CD or bond ladder, since yields are at their highest levels in more than a decade.\n",

      "Treat crypto with extreme caution\n",
      "\n",
      "The crippling “crypto winter” of 2022 pushed bitcoin down nearly 65% last year. The stablecoin TerraUSD fell to just 2 cents, a 98% drop from the US dollar to which it was supposed to be pegged. Meanwhile, several key crypto platforms like FTX, Voyager and Celsius collapsed amid allegations of mismanagement and fraud.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever your views of crypto’s long-term potential, it is still a very unregulated, uninsured space, which leaves individual investors highly vulnerable to losing their shirts when things sour. Don’t invest money you can’t afford to lose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certified financial adviser Ryan Sterling, founder of Future of You Wealth, advises his clients — who typically have at least $500,000 of assets in their portfolios — to keep their exposure to all crypto combined below 3% of their overall portfolio.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if their exposure falls below their initial allocation, Sterling wants them to leave it be. “In other words, if bitcoin was 3% of a client’s allocation and [it fell to] 1% … I am advising them to … not rebalance back to 3%.”\n",

      "Know your limitations\n",

      "News:  Editor’s Note: This an update of a story that originally published on December 20, 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "New York CNN Business —\n",
      "\n",
      "There will soon be new retirement rules in place that will make it easier for Americans to accumulate retirement savings – and make it less costly to withdraw them – now that lawmakers have passed an omnibus spending package, which President Joe Biden is expected to sign next week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Collectively the retirement savings provisions in that package are known as Secure 2.0.\n",
      "\n",
      "“[Secure 2.0] will help increase savings, ensure greater access to workplace retirement plans, and provide more workers with an opportunity to receive a secure stream of income in retirement,” said Thasunda Brown Duckett, president and CEO of TIAA, one of the largest US retirement service providers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s a look at seven of the Secure 2.0 provisions, based on a breakdown from the Senate Finance Committee.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Require auto enrollment in 401(k) plans\n",
      "\n",
      "Most employers starting new workplace retirement savings plans will be required to automatically enroll employees in the plan. (It is currently optional for employers to do so.) It will then be up to employees to actively opt out if they don’t wish to participate.\n",
      "\n",
      "This Secure 2.0 provision will require employers to set a default contribution rate of at least 3% but not more than 10% for the employee plus an automatic contribution escalation of 1% per year up to a maximum contribution rate of at least 10% but not more than 15%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The provision will go into effect after December 31, 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Allow employer contributions for student loan payments\n",
      "\n",
      "When you have to pay down student loan debt, it makes it harder to save for retirement. Secure 2.0 now lets employers make a matching contribution to an employee’s retirement plan based on their qualified student loan payments. That would ensure the employee is building retirement savings no matter what.\n",
      "\n",
      "The provision is set to take effect after December 31, 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Increase the age for required minimum distributions\n",
      "\n",
      "It used to be that when you turned 70 1/2, you had to start withdrawing a required minimum amount from your 401(k) or IRA every year. Then, the age moved up to 72. Under the Secure 2.0 package, it will move up to 73 starting in 2023 and then to 75 a decade later.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Help employees build and access emergency savings\n",
      "\n",
      "Normally, if you tap your 401(k) before age 59 1/2, you must not only pay taxes on that money but also pay a 10% early withdrawal penalty.\n",
      "\n",
      "For employees dissuaded from saving money in a tax-deferred retirement plan because it would be too complicated and costly to access for emergencies, Secure 2.0 may assuage that fear: It will let employees make a penalty-free withdrawal of up to $1,000 a year for emergencies. While employees would still owe income tax on that withdrawal in the year it’s made, they could get that tax refunded if they repay the withdrawal within three years.\n",
      "\n",
      "If they don’t repay the withdrawal, they would have to wait until the three-year repayment period ends before being allowed to make another emergency withdrawal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The provision will go into effect after December 31, 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Raise catch-up contribution limits for older workers\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, if you’re 50 or older, you may contribute an additional $6,500 to your 401(k) on top of the $20,500 annual federal limit in effect this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the retirement package, instead of $6,500, those aged 60, 61, 62 and 63 will be allowed to contribute $10,000 or 50% more than the regular catch-up amount in 2025, whichever is greater.\n",
      "\n",
      "The provision takes effect after December 31, 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "To help pay for the cost of the retirement package, however, another provision, which will go into effect a year earlier, will require anyone with compensation over $145,000 to “Rothify” their catch-up contributions. So, instead of making before-tax contributions up to the catch-up limit, you may still contribute the same amount but you will be taxed on it in the same year. Your contribution will then grow tax free and may be withdrawn tax free in retirement. But the federal government will get the tax revenue from the original catch-up contribution up front.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Enhance and simplify the Saver’s Credit\n",
      "\n",
      "An underutilized federal match exists for lower-income earners’ retirement contributions of up to $2,000 a year. The new package enhances and simplifies the so-called Saver’s Credit so more people can use it. Eligible filers (e.g., married couples making $71,000 or less) will get a matching contribution from the federal government worth up to 50% of their savings, but the match cannot exceed $1,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "The provision goes into effect after December 31, 2026.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Make it easier for part-time workers to save\n",
      "\n",
      "Part-time workers currently must be allowed to participate in a workplace retirement plan if they have three years of service and work at least 500 hours a year. The new package reduces that service time to two years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The provision takes effect after December 31, 2024.\n",

      "Title:  How to create some financial freedom to do what matters most to you\n",
      "News:  Let’s be honest: Saving and investing may be necessary, but they often can feel like a chore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both become a lot more rewarding, however, when you think of them as more than just spreading your money across different investment categories, such as stocks and bonds, to fund a seemingly far-off, no-guarantees future.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We obsess over investment allocation, but we don’t spend much time thinking about other allocations,” said Christine Benz, Morningstar’s director of personal finance and retirement planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Benz encourages everyone to focus on what she calls your “time on earth” allocation. That is, think about what is important to you and what you really want to spend more of your time doing – not just in retirement but today and in the foreseeable future.\n",
      "\n",
      "It could be that you want to travel to be with your aging parents more often. Maybe you want to step out of the workforce for a few years to be home with your kids. Or leave a well-paying job that sucks you dry for one that is less lucrative but more fulfilling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or maybe you just want to take a bucket-list vacation abroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hitting short-term and intermediate goals is so powerful,” Benz said. “For a lot of people [saving to buy] a first house is a catalyst for getting their whole financial life in order. You need to see a payoff.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s especially important for young adults, she added. “People in their 20s and 30s don’t identify with their 65-year-old selves. … It’s important to articulate shorter term escape hatches.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Meeting your ‘time on earth’ goals\n",
      "\n",
      "Spending more of your time in ways that are important to you is the goal. Setting up your finances to support that goal can transform saving and investing from fulfilling an obligation to creating a financial freedom fund for yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are three key ways to get started:\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure out how you are allocating your income between spending and investing. “How are you deploying your income stream? Are you making smart decisions to deploy that capital across your financial opportunities?” Benz said.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, she suggested, would it make financial sense to prepay your mortgage – something that can save you a lot of money over time if your current mortgage rate is higher than the return your extra payments could earn if you parked them in a conservative investment vehicle like a CD.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a shorter term boost – say, paying for a splurge vacation, saving for a second home or even funding a longed-for sabbatical in a few years– it may be okay to buck convention, Benz suggested, especially if you have a long time horizon to retirement. Instead of maxing out your 401(k), you might reduce your contributions a little and redirect that money to a taxable brokerage account.\n",
      "\n",
      "“While there are no tax incentives to contribute to a taxable brokerage account, there are no strictures on withdrawals either, and gains are taxed at today’s fairly low capital gains rate,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider tradeoffs. “We make so many decisions that are time-money tradeoffs,” Benz said.\n",
      "\n",
      "It could be a decision to hire a housekeeper versus doing everything yourself. Would it break the bank to get some help if it frees up your time on weekends to be with friends and family? Or do you get satisfaction from cleaning and saving money?\n",
      "\n",
      "Or it could be a more expensive decision, such as deciding whether to buy a bigger home with a lot of upkeep versus a smaller one. Do you need to live in as large a house or will a smaller home nearby work just as well for you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Does your well-paying job leave you little time for anything else? If not, are there other opportunities that could still fund your needs without taking such a big bite out of your life?\n",
      "\n",
      "Look for ways to cut back now. Yes, a budget can be annoying. But if it helps free up cash by reining in your current spending on things that aren’t really making you happy, it’s worth a shot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Identifying spending cuts is the richest vein for most people,” Benz said. “That could support your decision to move to a lower paying job or retire earlier.”\n"

      "That, of course, means higher borrowing costs for consumers. But it also means your savings may actually start earning a little money after years of barely-there interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Credit card rates are at a record high and still increasing. Auto loan rates are at an 11-year high. Home equity lines of credit are at a 15-year high. And online savings account and CD yields haven’t been this high since 2008,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are a few ways to situate your money so that you can benefit from rising rates, and protect yourself from their downside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bank savings: Shop around\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’ve been stashing cash at big banks that have been paying next to nothing in interest for savings accounts and certificates of deposit, don’t expect that to change much, McBride said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to the big players’ paltry rates, the national average savings rate is still just 0.16%, up from 0.06% in January, according to Bankrate.com’s October 26 weekly survey of large institutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "But all those Fed rates hikes are starting to have a more significant impact at online banks and credit unions, McBride said. They’re offering far higher rates – with some topping 3% currently – and have been increasing them as benchmark rates go higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for certificates of deposit, there’s been a noticeable increase in return. The average rate on a one-year credit union CD is 1.05% as of October 27, up from 0.14% at the start of the year. But top-yielding one-year CDs now offer as much as 4%.\n",
      "\n",
      "So shop around. If you make a switch to an online bank or credit union, however, be sure to only choose those that are federally insured.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another high-yield savings option\n",
      "\n",
      "Given today’s high rates of inflation, Series I savings bonds may be attractive because they’re designed to preserve the buying power of your money. They’re currently paying 6.89%.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that rate will only be in effect for six months and only if you buy an I Bond by the end of April 2023, after which the rate is scheduled to adjust. If inflation falls, the rate on the I Bond will fall, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some limitations. You can only invest $10,000 a year. You can’t redeem it in the first year. And if you cash out between years two and five, you will forfeit the previous three months of interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In other words, I Bonds are not a replacement for your savings account,” McBride said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, they preserve the buying power of your $10,000 if you don’t need to touch it for at least five years, and that’s not nothing. They also may be of particular benefit to people planning to retire in the next 5 to 10 years since they will serve as a safe annual investment they can tap if needed in their first few years of retirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Credit cards: Minimize the bite\n",
      "\n",
      "When the overnight bank lending rate – also known as the fed funds rate – goes up, various lending rates that banks offer their customers tend to follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "So you can expect to see a hike in your credit card rates within a few statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, the average credit card rate is 17.85%, up from 16.3% at the start of the year, according to Bankrate.com.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This latest interest rate hike will most acutely impact those consumers who do not pay off their credit card balances in full through higher minimum monthly payments,” said Michele Raneri, vice president of US research and consulting at TransUnion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Best advice: If you’re carrying balances on your credit cards – which typically have high variable interest rates – consider transferring them to a zero-rate balance transfer card that locks in a zero rate for between 12 and 21 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That insulates you from [future] rate hikes, and it gives you a clear runway to pay off your debt once and for all,” McBride said. “Less debt and more savings will enable you to better weather rising interest rates, and is especially valuable if the economy sours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Just be sure to find out what, if any, fees you will have to pay (e.g., a balance transfer fee or annual fee), and what the penalties will be if you make a late payment or miss a payment during the zero-rate period. The best strategy is always to pay off as much of your existing balance as possible – and to do so on time every month – before the zero-rate period ends. Otherwise, any remaining balance will be subject to a new interest rate that could be higher than you had before if rates continue to rise.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you don’t transfer to a zero-rate balance card, another option might be to get a relatively low fixed-rate personal loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Home loans: Lock in fixed rates now\n",
      "\n",
      "Mortgage rates have been rising over the past year, jumping more than two percentage points since January.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.08% in the week ending October 27, according to Freddie Mac. That is more than double where it stood a year ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "“After cresting above 7%, mortgage rates have pulled back a bit but not enough to impact buyer affordability. The year-to-date rise in mortgage rates has still stripped would-be homebuyers of one-third of their buying power,” McBride said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And mortgage rates may climb even further.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if you’re close to buying a home or refinancing one, lock in the lowest fixed rate available to you as soon as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, “don’t jump into a large purchase that isn’t right for you just because interest rates might go up. Rushing into the purchase of a big-ticket item like a house or car that doesn’t fit in your budget is a recipe for trouble, regardless of what interest rates do in the future,” said Texas-based certified financial planner Lacy Rogers.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re already a homeowner with a variable-rate home equity line of credit, and you used part of it to do a home improvement project, McBride recommends asking your lender if it’s possible to fix the rate on your outstanding balance, effectively creating a fixed-rate home equity loan. Say you have a $50,000 line of credit but only used $20,000 for a renovation. You would ask to have a fixed rate applied to the $20,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "If that’s not possible, consider paying off that balance by taking out a HELOC with another lender at a lower promotional rate, McBride suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stocks: Seek broad exposure and pricing power\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to investing, two big factors to consider are the effects of inflation on companies and consumers, and the geopolitical outlook.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s not to say markets won’t remain choppy in the near term. But, Ma noted, “A soft landing for the economy looks not only possible but likely.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Any cash you have sitting on the sidelines might be put into the equity and fixed income markets in regular intervals over the next six to 12 months, he suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some stock plays\n",
      "\n",
      "Ma remains bullish on value stocks, especially small cap ones, which have outperformed this year. “We expect that outperformance to persist going forward on a multi-year basis,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding real estate, Ma noted, “the sharply higher interest and mortgage rates are challenging…and that headwind could persist for a few more quarters or even longer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, he added, “commodities have come down in price but still are a good hedge given the uncertainty in energy markets.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Broadly speaking, however, Ma suggests making sure your overall portfolio is diversified across equities. The idea is to hedge your bets, since some of those areas will come out ahead, but not all of them will.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, if you’re planning to invest in a specific stock, consider the company’s pricing power and how consistent the demand is likely to be for their product, said certified financial planner Doug Flynn, co-founder of Flynn Zito Capital Management.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bonds: Go short\n",
      "\n",
      "To the extent you already own bonds, the prices on your bonds will fall in a rising rate environment. But if you’re in the market to buy bonds you can benefit from that trend, especially if you purchase short-term bonds, meaning one to three years, since prices have fallen more than usual relative to long-term bonds. Normally, they move lower in tandem.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s a pretty good opportunity in short-term bonds, which are severely dislocated,” Flynn said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For those in higher-income tax brackets, a similar opportunity exists in tax-free municipal bonds.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Muni prices have dropped significantly and, while they have started to improve, yields have risen overall and many states are in better financial shape than they were pre-pandemic, Flynn noted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ma also recommends short-term corporate bonds or short-term Agency or Treasury securities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other assets that may do well are so-called floating rate instruments from companies that need to raise cash, Flynn said. The floating rate is often benchmarked against the fed funds rate, so it will go up whenever the Fed hikes rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if you’re not a bond expert, you’d be better off investing in a fund that specializes in making the most of a rising rate environment through floating rate instruments and other bond income strategies. Flynn recommends looking for a strategic income or flexible income mutual fund, which will hold an array of different types of bonds.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t see a lot of these choices in 401(k)s,” he said. But you can always ask your 401(k) provider to include the option in your employer’s plan.\n"

      "As of early Thursday, however, the former employee said they had yet to receive any documents related to a severance agreement or offer. Other laid-off employees tweeted similar remarks this week, including one who said they had “never even seen a severance letter let alone been offered severance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A spokesperson for Shannon Liss-Riordan, the attorney representing hundreds of former Twitter employees, confirmed that her clients who were hit by the Twitter layoffs in early November also had yet to receive any severance information as of Thursday. “There was some anticipation that they would be sent yesterday, but we haven’t seen that,” Kevin Ready, the spokesperson, said of the severance agreements.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yesterday was the official separation date for thousands of Twitter employees, and after months of chaos and uncertainty created by Elon Musk, these workers remain in the lurch,” Liss-Riordan said in a Thursday statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The employee concerns come as Musk scrambles to cut costs at the company he bought in October for $44 billion, including a significant amount of debt. After laying off half the company in early November, Musk continued cutting and pushing out additional employees, including by requiring anyone who remained to sign a pledge committing to “hardcore” work.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company was recently sued by a commercial landlord and a private flight company alleging Twitter has failed to pay bills. And The New York Times last month reported that Twitter was considering denying laid off employees their severance as a cost-cutting measure, citing people familiar with the talks among company leadership, adding to the sense of uncertainty for affected workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twitter, which cut much of its public relations department as part of the layoffs, did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the claims it has not offered or paid any severance. At the time of the layoffs, Musk promised that “everyone exited was offered 3 months of severance,” a time period that appears to include the 60-days advanced notice Twitter was obligated to provide.\n",
      "\n",
      "A report by Fortune on Thursday afternoon, citing an unnamed source familiar with the situation and screenshots viewed by the publication, said that Twitter planned to send severance agreements to affected employees on Thursday, although it was unclear exactly when they would go out. The severance agreements were set to provide laid off US employees with one month’s base pay and would include a provision requiring employees to waive participation in pending lawsuits against the company, according to the report.\n",
      "\n",
      "Liss-Riordan has filed four proposed class action lawsuits against Twitter on behalf of employees affected by layoffs, with claims including that Twitter backtracked on promises to allow remote work and consistent severance benefits, as well as complaints related to alleged disability and gender-based discrimination. She has also filed three claims against Twitter with the National Labor Relations Board on behalf of former employees. Liss-Riordan said Thursday that she has also filed another 100 demands for arbitration against Twitter on behalf of former employees, after filing an initial 100 last month.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last month, the employees represented by Liss-Riordan scored an early win in court when a judge ordered Twitter to inform laid-off employees of the pending lawsuits before asking them to sign any separation agreements that include a release of legal claims.\n",

      "Title:  Hackers post email addresses linked to 200 million Twitter accounts, security researchers say\n",
      "News:  CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "Email addresses linked to more than 200 million Twitter profiles are currently circulating on underground hacker forums, security experts say. The apparent data leak could expose the real-life identities of anonymous Twitter users and make it easier for criminals to hijack Twitter accounts, the experts warned, or even victims’ accounts on other websites.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trove of leaked records also includes Twitter users’ names, account handles, follower numbers and the dates the accounts were created, according to forum listings reviewed by security researchers and shared with CNN.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bad actors have won the jackpot,” said Rafi Mendelsohn, a spokesman for Cyabra, a social media analysis firm focused on identifying disinformation and inauthentic online behavior. “Previously private data such as emails, handles, and creation date can be leveraged to build smarter and more sophisticated hacking, phishing and disinformation campaigns.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Some reports suggested the data was collected in 2021 through a bug in Twitter’s systems, a flaw the company fixed in 2022 after a separate incident in July involving 5.4 million Twitter accounts alerted the company to the vulnerability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Troy Hunt, a security researcher, said Thursday that his analysis of the data “found 211,524,284 unique email addresses” that had been leaked. The Washington Post earlier reported a forum listing promoting the data of 235 million accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hunt did not immediately respond to a question from CNN asking whether the records would be added to his website, haveibeenpwned.com, which allows users to search hacked records to determine if they have been affected. CNN has not independently verified the records’ authenticity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twitter didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Its communication team, along with roughly half of Twitter’s overall workforce, was gutted after billionaire Elon Musk completed his acquisition the company in late October. The significant staff reductions could now add to concerns about the company’s ability to respond to security threats.\n",
      "\n",
      "The breadth of the leaked data could allow malicious actors or repressive governments to connect anonymous Twitter handles with the real names or email addresses of their owners, potentially unmasking dissidents, journalists, activists or other at-risk users around the world, security researchers warn.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For those people, this is a very consequential breach,” said John Scott-Railton, a security researcher at The University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab.\n",
      "\n",
      "The account data could also be valuable to hackers who can use the information as part of password-reset attempts and account takeovers. The risk is particularly high for individuals who use the same account credentials on Twitter as they do for other digital services such as banks or cloud storage, researchers said, because hackers could take information gleaned from the leak to pry open user accounts elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Verified Twitter users caught up in the apparent leak, or users with particularly large followings, will be particularly valuable targets as a result of the leak, security experts warned, as those account holders may be especially influential celebrities or susceptible to extortion.\n",
      "\n",
      "To protect themselves from phishing attempts, internet users should use unique passwords for each online service and keep track of them using a digital password manager, security researchers say. They should also enable multi-factor authentication for each of their accounts, and exercise caution when opening unsolicited email or links.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the cybersecurity news outlet BleepingComputer, which did claim to test the data, the latest dump appears similar to a leaked dataset advertised on hacking forums in November containing an alleged 400 million records, but slimmed down to eliminate some duplicate records. Twitter has not commented on that leak.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reports of the leak could expand Twitter’s already significant legal and regulatory risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "In December, Twitter’s main European privacy regulator, the Irish Data Protection Commission, said it is investigating the July 2022 leak as a possible violation of Europe’s signature privacy law, known as GDPR.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last summer, the company’s former head of security, Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, filed a whistleblower report to the US government alleging long-ignored security vulnerabilities in Twitter’s operations. Zatko claimed that Twitter’s shortcomings on security reflected a breach of Twitter’s binding commitments to the Federal Trade Commission, a serious offense. (Twitter broadly and repeatedly pushed back at Zatko’s allegations.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Successive incidents at Twitter have led to the company signing two consent orders with the FTC since 2011 to improve its cybersecurity posture. Violations of FTC orders can lead to fines, business restrictions and even sanctions targeting individual executives.\n",
      "\n",
      "In November, top Twitter officials responsible for privacy and security resigned from the company, just days after Musk closed his purchase of the platform and amid the mass layoffs that in some cases cut whole departments.\n"

      "News:  New York CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’ve been watching coverage of the unfolding drama taking place in the House, you’ve likely noticed that the camera shots are not the usual stale wide-pans that saturate C-SPAN on a day-to-day basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually, the House forbids independent media coverage of proceedings, meaning that networks must rely on a government feed for coverage. But when there are special events taking place in the House, such as the election for speaker, independent coverage is allowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, that translates to C-SPAN deploying multiple cameras of its own into the House chamber, giving the public a rare front row view of the high-stakes negotiations between lawmakers.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, C-SPAN’s cameras showed Republican Rep. Paul Gosar, who has voted against Kevin McCarthy for speaker, on the floor speaking Tuesday with Democratic Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez. Gosar was asking Ocasio-Cortez if any Democrats were planning to leave the floor or vote present so McCarthy could have a lower threshold, according to Ocasio-Cortez spokesperson Lauren Hitt. Ocasio-Cortez, according to Hitt, told Gosar that there was no plan to do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The image of seeing the two next to each other is striking: The House voted to censure Gosar and remove him from committees in November 2021 after Gosar photoshopped an anime video to social media showing him appearing to kill Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Joe Biden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Normally, those interactions would be shielded from public view.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are able to show Paul Gosar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez sitting down and speaking to one another. We are able to show Matt Gaetz and Jim Jordan talking before the next votes,” Ben O’Connell, C-SPAN’s director of editorial operations, told me by phone. “We are able to show scrums of members migrate across the floor as negotiations go on. You don’t see that during standard coverage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "O’Connell noted that C-SPAN would like to be able to do this far more often. The organization has petitioned Congress dozens of times throughout the years to allow it greater editorial discretion over the camera shots it chooses to air.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It would be great if we could provide this kind of coverage even during deliberations on major legislations or other times beyond the speaker election and more ceremonial functions of Congress,” he said. “We hope some day cameras are allowed in there far more frequently than they are now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think it is really important for journalists to be behind the cameras rather than the government be behind the cameras,” O’Connell added. “We, during a typical legislative day, have a government entity covering the government. And I think it would be invaluable to have journalists behind the camera instead.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When cameras were first allowed, they became a potent political weapon. In the 1980s and early 1990s, congressmen such as Republican Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia – later the House speaker – would give speeches criticizing Democrats meant only for the TV cameras. There would be few people in the chamber, and since lawmakers could speak on any subject, it seemed as if there were no answers from the other side.\n",

      "Then-House Speaker Tip O’Neill eventually ordered the cameras to show the full empty chamber and chastised Gingrich, setting off a partisan fight that helped elevate Gingrich and humiliated the Democratic speaker.\n",

      "Tide is shifting\n",
      "\n",
      "Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is substantially less – as much as 73% cheaper – than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,” he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,” said Golan. “Natural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn’t an infinite supply of them.”\n",

      "Title:  The Chevrolet Corvette is officially going electric\n",
      "News:  CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reuss didn’t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. “We will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,” he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Reuss’s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it’s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Electrified” is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as “electrified.” It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car.\n",
      "\n",
      "Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla’s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn’t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari’s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reuss has previously implied a hybrid Corvette was possible. General Motors\n",
      "\n",
      "GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.\n",

      "News:  CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "Scoot over, Facebook and Instagram.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s a newer photo-sharing app – and it’s not like other social media platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The app is called BeReal. And while you may not have heard of it, a lot of young people are signing up. Its active monthly users have skyrocketed this year by more than 315%, according to data from Apptopia, which tracks and analyzes performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "We joined the app and talked to users to get a deeper understanding of how BeReal works and what you need to know about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, what’s BeReal?\n",
      "\n",
      "BeReal is a social media app that encourages users to share a slice of their life in real time. It was launched in early 2020 by an entrepreneur in France but a majority of its users – at least 65% – have signed up this calendar year.\n",
      "\n",
      "As its name suggests, the focus is on authenticity. Users are invited once a day to share a photo of what they’re doing at that moment, giving friends and others an unvarnished glimpse into their life.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has no filters and no edit buttons. So if your hair is a mess at that moment and your view is of a rainy parking lot, that’s what people will see.\n",
      "\n",
      "The result is a far cry from the polished, overly curated photos popular on other social media platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The BeReal app launched in late 2020 and is rapidly growing in popularity among young people. Austin Steele/CNN\n",
      "\n",
      "How does it work?\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept of BeReal is simple. Once you download the app, you get a notification once a day that it’s time to “BeReal.” That means you have two minutes to snap and post a photo of what you’re doing, no matter how mundane.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s no set time – the notification comes at random times of the day – adding to the app’s mystique.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Push notifications are sent around the world simultaneously at different times each day,” the company said in a statement. “It’s a secret on how the time is chosen every day, it’s not random.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That means the potential window into your life can open at any time. When it does, the app invites you to take a photo of what you’re up to at that moment. It takes a dual photo – a selfie and one showing what’s in front of you. (BeReal doesn’t permit videos yet.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The result is a social feed filled with unedited photos of people doing mostly everyday, unglamorous things – lounging in pajamas, doing homework, riding the bus, microwaving their dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "With only one post a day, there’s no clutter of friends’ pictures to mindlessly scroll through. You can only see friends’ posts if you share a photo, which eliminates lurkers. Some people turn off their location for privacy reasons, since the app works in real time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Georgetown University student Ben Telerski, 21, is an avid social media user and joined the app in August.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What I like about BeReal is I am able to make connections with my friends via social media on a platform that does not incentivize likes, comments, or being artificial. … solely showing your friends what you are doing at the moment that the daily alert goes off,” says Telerski, a junior majoring in government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Telerski says the posts he sees on the app are generally more authentic compared to other social media platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I try to post as soon as I see the notification, even if I am just sitting in bed or walking to class,” he says. “I think the amount of authenticity depends on the persona each person creates on social media. If someone tries to keep their social media presence highly polished and produced, BeReal is not the app to use.”\n",

      "Ben Telerski and Alexandra Henn in an image from his BeReal app. The app takes a dual photo showing the user's selfie and what's in front of them. Courtesy Ben Telerski\n",

      "What happens if you don’t post within the two minutes?\n",
      "\n",
      "When you click on the once-a-day BeReal notification, your camera opens within the app along with a timer with a two-minute countdown. You have until the timer runs out to take a picture of what’s in front of you. At the same time, your rear-facing camera snaps a selfie.\n",
      "\n",
      "The app will share both images. You can retake them anytime during the two minutes and share them with friends when you’re ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "BeReal also allows users to take and post the photo later in the day. But it lets your friends know how many hours past the notification that you posted. In short, it puts you on blast for your lack of spontaneity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why are people using it?\n",
      "\n",
      "BeReal has tapped into marketing on college campuses. It recruits young users via its college ambassador program, which allows students to host events that educate others about the app.\n",
      "\n",
      "Telerski believes the app is popular because it’s an antidote to the pressures to look perfect online.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have seen a lot of news coverage lately about the negative mental health impacts that social media has on Gen Z. I do not know if BeReal is directly attempting to combat this problem, but it is certainly making some ground toward that goal,” he says.\n",

      "\n",
      "Morgan Nott, 26, manages a tea shop in Reno and is a newbie on the app. She started using it last week at a friend’s suggestion. Nott says she finds it refreshing to get a non-airbrushed, non-idealized glimpse into other people’s lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s the authenticity of it that makes it so appealing. Users aren’t as glamorized or fake as some can portray themselves on other platforms,” she says. “It’s something different.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement, BeReal says its goal is to create “an alternative to addictive social networks” that focus on amassing influence, it says.\n",
      "\n",
      "“BeReal is your chance to show your friends who you really are,” the company says. “BeReal won’t make you famous, if you want to become an influencer you can stay on TikTok and Instagram.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Are BeReal posts really so authentic?\n",
      "\n",
      "The app doesn’t give you much time to put on makeup or stage your surroundings before you snap and post photos.\n",
      "\n",
      "But some users may still try to curate their lives on the app.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is the potential to be just as artificial on BeReal as people tend to be on other platforms,” Telerski says. Some people might ignore the notification to post at a certain time and wait to post until they are dressed up and out at dinner with friends, he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is not in the spirit of BeReal and entirely defeats the purpose,” he says. “BeReal should be full of pictures of (people) walking, doing homework and sitting in bed watching Netflix.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The young people CNN spoke to have no plans to give up Instagram, TikTok and other social media apps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nott says she plans to keep letting her guard down on BeReal – and to keep posting on other social media platforms as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Telerski says he tries to maintain a certain level of authenticity on social media regardless of the platform. Authenticity is determined by a person, not an app, he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For those who think we need a new social media app in order to be truly authentic, maybe we should take that as a sign to be more authentic throughout our existing social media presence,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Think about what social media was originally intended for – real connection through family and friends keeping up with your life. Maybe we should get back to that.”\n"

      "Title:  BMW i7 electric car revealed\n",
      "News:  CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "Electric vehicles, with their need for lots of expensive batteries, have often trended towards luxury. Electric cars from Porsche, Mercedes, and Audi have all hit the market in recent years. BMW has come out with its own electric cars like the iX and i4 and now the new i7, a battery-powered take on the brand’s new most expensive sedan.\n",
      "\n",
      "While BMW is probably better known for its smaller 3 Series and 4 Series cars, the 7 Series is the brand’s showpiece for luxury and technology. The i7 is the electric version of a new generation of the BMW 7 Series flagship unveiled on Wednesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a starting price of $119,300, the all-wheel-drive 536 horsepower i7 xDrive60 will be able to go 300 miles on a full charge, which is less than the competing Mercedes EQS or Lucid Air. It will also offer a V8-powered gasoline version, the 760i X-drive, with the same horsepower output and a starting price that’s $300 less. It will look almost identical. A gas-powered version with a 6-cylinder engine will have a starting price of $93,300.\n",
      "\n",
      "This new version also highlights BMW’s flexibility-first electric vehicle strategy, which is different from that of luxury competitors like Mercedes-Benz and Audi. While those other luxury brands’ electric vehicles are based on dedicated EV chassis with little relationship to their gas-powered models, BMW emphasizes adaptable engineering as its edge.\n",
      "\n",
      "BMW feels that it makes more sense to engineer gasoline- and battery-powered vehicles together. BMW\n",
      "\n",
      "BMW has engineered all its new models so they can be built with internal combustion engines, fully electric power or as plug-in hybrids that combine both electric and gas power. BMW executives insist this is not just a matter of fitting batteries and electric motors into cars that were intended to have gas engines. Instead, these vehicles have been designed, from the outset, to be built with any of these drive systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "A major benefit of doing it this way, BMW executives say, is that it gives the company flexibility to easily produce more – or fewer – electric cars or gas-powered cars on the same assembly lines rather than having to commit manufacturing resources just to EVs. With cars and SUVs designed to be built as either, the car maker also doesn’t risk putting millions of dollars of development costs into an electric-only model that might find little demand in some markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another benefit, BMW chairman Oliver Zipse said, is that customers needn’t choose between two completely different models when deciding whether they want an electric or gas-powered car. They can just decide they want to buy a BMW 7 Series, then choose whether they want the gasoline or electric version, just as they might decide whether they want a V8 or a straight-6 engine. Either way, customers get the same luxury car experience and design.\n",
      "\n",
      "The downside of a common engineering platform is that, to enable both electric and gasoline power, designers need compromises. Cars with internal combustion engines need a large amount of free space up front for the engine, a smaller one typically under the trunk for the fuel tank, and often a long tunnel down the middle to connect the engine to the wheels. Electric cars, on the other hand, can have smaller electric motors mounted closer to individual wheels, and while they don’t have a fuel tank or a transmission tunnel, they need a large, relatively flat area, typically on the bottom of the car, for the batteries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mercedes EQS electric sedan, for example, has only a short hood that houses some electronic components, and it has a nearly flat floor allowing more interior storage space.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zipse insisted the 7 Series represents a superior full-size luxury sedan regardless of its power source. The driving experience will be excellent, he said, as will interior comfort and technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no car with a more spacious, luxurious second row,” he said, during a meeting with journalists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back seats are a major reason for buying this sort of large car. In full-size sedans, there generally isn’t much more room (if any) in the front seats compared to smaller cars. The extra space usually goes to those in the back.\n",
      "\n",
      "BMW drivers will hear \"engine sounds\" created in cooperation with Oscar-winning film composer Hans Zimmer BMW\n",
      "\n",
      "As in many other high-end large cars, the back seats can recline while leg and foot rests rise from beneath seats. (BMW claims its seats recline more than competitors’, though.) The front passenger seat, if it’s unoccupied, can also move forward and fold down to allow more space.\n",
      "\n",
      "BMW 7 Series buyers can get an optional 31-inch high-resolution video screen that folds down from the roof to provide entertainment for back seat passengers. Combined with an available high-end stereo system and powered window shades to block out light, the 7 Series can be a better place to watch a movie than someone’s own living room, according to BMW. Front seat occupants can also watch streaming videos on the center screen when the car is parked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four-wheel steering will enable the car to turn more tightly on curvy roads and in parking lots and to change lanes more smoothly on the highway. Inside, there are few knobs and buttons. Instead, buttons appear as lighted icons on a strip of what looks like decorative trim that runs across the dashboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "The car’s headlights are obscured by dark coverings while, above them, turn signals and daytime running lights are housed in prominent narrow bars. As an option, the turn signals and daytime lights can include Swarovski crystals that sparkle in sunlight. As another option, the 7 Series’ large “kidney” grille can be outlined in lights at night.\n",
      "\n",
      "For when the driver would rather not bother, assistance technologies allow the driver to completely let go of the steering wheel for long periods on divided highways. This technology, similar to General Motors’ Super Cruise, requires drives to keep their eyes on the road ahead at all times.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 7 Series can automatically drive itself into and out of parking spaces even with the driver outside the vehicle using a smartphone app. It can also drive itself through a pre-programmed course, such as around pylons in a parking garage, on its own, a feature somewhat similar to Tesla’s Summon mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sophisticated “head up display” which displays data in the car’s windscreen can align images and text so they appear as if laid over roads and other features in the real world. The system can also display parking regulations in the area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Performance is a core part of BMW’s brand image. For decades, BMW’s marketing tagline was: “The Ultimate Driving Machine.” Executives now say that electric vehicles will take the lead in the carmaker’s performance pantheon with the fastest and most powerful versions of its vehicles being battery-powered. With the new 7 Series, the i7 shares its ranking as the most powerful version with the V8-powered 760i. There are no plans for a V12-powered 7-series model in this generation of the car.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sophisticated air suspension works automatically to keep the car level even in fast turns. Computers can use data from GPS maps and cameras on the front of the car to predict when an upcoming curve will require the suspension system to react.\n",
      "\n",
      "BMW has said that half of the cars the company sells worldwide will be electric by 2030. That includes Rolls-Royce and Mini vehicles. Both of those iconic British brands are owned by BMW, and plan to sell only electric vehicles by 2030.\n",

      "\n",
      "Based on net worth calculations by Bloomberg, Bankman-Fried was worth about $16 billion at the start of the week. But as his crypto exchange, FTX, collapsed, the value of his assets was reduced to zero in what Bloomberg called “one of history’s greatest-ever destructions of wealth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "FTX on Friday said it filed for bankruptcy, and Bankman-Fried, known as SBF, resigned as chief executive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 30-year-old entrepreneur’s net worth, which was largely tied up in digital assets, peaked at around $26 billion this spring. Over the summer, as crypto prices plummeted, Bankman-Fried emerged as a white knight for the sector, using his FTX exchange and its sister hedge fund, Alameda, to secure lines of credit to crypto companies like BlockFi and Voyager that were at risk of collapsing.\n",
      "\n",
      "He told Reuters in July that he and FTX still had a “few billion” on hand to shore up other firms and help stabilize the industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bankman-Fried owns about 70% of FTX’s US business, which the index now estimates to be essentially worthless. His stake in online brokerage Robinhood, previously valued at more than $500 million, was removed from Bloomberg’s calculation after news reports said that stake was held through Alameda and may have been used as collateral for loans.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a follower of “effective altruism,” Bankman-Fried has sought to make as much money as possible in order to give it away. But the fate of his philanthropic endeavors is now in doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Thursday, the entire staff of the FTX Future Fund, which says it has committed $160 million in grants, publicly quit. In a statement, the five-person team wrote that they “have fundamental questions about the legitimacy and integrity of the business operations that were funding the FTX Foundation and the Future Fund.”\n"

      "In the space of a week, a 30-year-old entrepreneur once hailed as a modern-day J.P. Morgan watched his digital empire, including billions of his own fortune, evaporate in a death spiral that’s shaken the foundations of the trillion-dollar crypto industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Thursday, Sam Bankman-Fried issued a mea culpa: “I f**ked up,” he wrote in a lengthy Twitter thread, apologizing to investors and customers of FTX, the exchange platform he founded in 2019. By Friday morning, FTX said Bankman-Fried had resigned as CEO and that the firm was filing for bankruptcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Failures are not uncommon in the murky, largely unregulated world of crypto, but FTX is not your average crypto startup. Its near-collapse this week represents a potential turning point for an industry that many critics say has been given a pass for far too long.\n",

      "So, what happened to FTX, and why is the entire crypto space freaking out about it? There are still a lot of uncertainties, but here’s what we know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fishy finances\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week, the crypto news website CoinDesk published an article based on a leaked financial document from Bankman-Fried’s hedge fund, Alameda Research.\n",
      "\n",
      "The report suggested that Alameda’s business rested on shaky financial footing. Namely, that the bulk of its assets are held in FTT, a digital token minted by Alameda’s sister firm, FTX. That was a red flag for investors, as the companies were, on paper at least, separate. Alameda’s disproportionate holdings of the token, however, suggested the two were much more closely linked.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Sunday, the CEO of Binance, FTX’s much larger rival, said his company was liquidating $580 million worth of FTX holdings. That set off a firestorm of draw downs that FTX didn’t have the cash to facilitate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rivals come together\n",
      "\n",
      "By Monday, concerns about Alameda and FTX had bled into the broader crypto market. But Bankman-Fried was defiant, tweeting that FTX and its assets were “fine.” He also sparred with the CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, whose tweet had fueled the run on FTX deposits.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was clearly bad blood between the two, which is why it shocked the industry when the pair announced a tentative deal Tuesday for Binance to bail out FTX.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This afternoon, FTX asked for our help,” Zhao tweeted that afternoon, noting that there was a “significant liquidity crunch” at the company and that Binance would have to conduct corporate due diligence before going forward with any deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost immediately after getting a look at under the hood, though, Binance began to backtrack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried’s personal fortune also tumbled. According to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index, Bankman-Fried’s net worth cratered 94% in a single day, from more than $15 billion to just under $1 billion — the biggest one-day loss ever clocked by the index. (The estimate of his wealth was based on the assumption that Binance would ultimately bail out FTX, where much of Bankman-Fried’s personal assets are held. Which means his net worth may have farther to fall.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The flip-flop\n",

      "On Wednesday, cryptocurrencies continued to slump as investor anxiety about the FTX bailout spread. Bitcoin and ether, the two most popular tokens, both hit their lowest level in two years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The selloff deepened after media reports emerged that Binance was leaning toward walking away from the deal. Sure enough, on Wednesday afternoon, Zhao tweeted a withering assessment of FTX’s problems:\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the beginning, our hope was to be able to support FTX’s customers to provide liquidity, but the issues are beyond our control or ability to help.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Since the Binance deal fell apart, Bankman-Fried has been scrambling to raise funds. On Thursday, tweeted that there were “a number of players” the firm was in talks with.\n",

      "\n",
      "Workers at a California Amazon facility withdrew their petition late last week to unionize with the ALU, just days after the labor group failed to win enough votes to unionize an Amazon facility in upstate New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kayla Blado, a spokesperson for the National Labor Relations Board, confirmed to CNN Business on Tuesday that the petition for a union election at the ONT8 facility in Moreno Valley, California, had been withdrawn. Blado added that the petitioner does not have to provide a reason to the NLRB for doing so. The move to withdraw comes roughly two weeks after the petition was submitted, per the NLRB’s docket of the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an email to CNN Business, ALU President Chris Smalls played down the significance of the withdrawn petition. “The withdrawal isn’t nothing to worry about,” he said. “We will be refilling within the next few weeks just as we did with our JFK8 campaign,” Smalls added, referring to the name of the unionized facility in Staten Island, New York.\n",

In addition to the Amazon workers near Albany voting against joining the union last week, the ALU also failed to win enough votes to unionize a smaller Amazon outpost in Staten Island.\n",

      "\n",
      "Interest rates on nearly all credit cards and home equity lines of credit will increase after this latest rate hike, and borrowers with variable interest rates will notice the difference quickly, said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate.\n",

      "At a little over 18%, the average annual percentage rate (APR) on new credit cards is within a percentage point of its all-time high of 19% set in July of 1991, according to Rossman. “The effect on existing credit card borrowers is probably actually worse,” he said, because of the rate hikes the Fed has undertaken already this year. “Chances are your credit card is already 2.25 percentage points higher than it was in March.”\n",

      "Personal finance pros say the best strategy when rates are rising is to pay down or consolidate debts, but as prices on all sorts of goods and services rise, Americans are gorging on debt of all stripes. Borrowers are both opening new cards and charging more on the ones they already have.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What they’re doing is borrowing future income by taking on debt. That’s why we are seeing a big surge in credit card borrowing right now… to maintain their current standard of living,” said Steve Rick, chief economist at CUNA Mutual Group.\n",
      "\n",
      "In August, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said that total household debt grew in the second quarter by $312 billion to a total of $16.15 trillion. Credit cards were a big cause of that: In the second quarter, 233 million new credit accounts were opened, the largest increase since 2008. Of the new debt that accumulated during that quarter, $46 billion was credit card debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Credit bureau TransUnion found that there are more credit cards today, and there is more debt on those cards. TransUnion said 161.6 million people in the US — roughly half of the total population — had access to a credit card in the second quarter, a jump from 153.3 million a year earlier. In that same time frame, the average debt per borrower rose from $4,817 to $5,270.\n",
      "\n",
      "Higher prices are feeding America’s appetite for credit. “Inflation is certainly a significant factor. If the same services and goods that they have always been consuming suddenly are more expensive, consumers may use credit to help with the short-term funding of those purchases,” said Michele Ranieri, vice president of U.S. research and consulting at TransUnion. “For many consumers, credit is not just about added debt but also serves as a necessary spending vehicle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ranieri framed this as a positive development — as long as borrowers can keep up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The fact that more consumers have access to credit is positive as long as we don’t see a significant increase in delinquencies,” she said. However, she acknowledged that the rapid adoption of Buy Now, Pay Later plans, which typically aren’t captured in conventional banking and consumer credit reporting, could be obscuring the true picture of some debtors’ positions.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It takes years to accumulate behaviors of new products like BNPL to accurately analyze them and incorporate them into consumer credit scores and credit decisions,” she said. “We have been actively working with lenders to ensure that as much debt as possible is being reflected on consumer credit reports.”\n",

Credit utilization, a ratio of how much available credit a person has used as a percentage of their credit limit, has been rising since early 2021. According to Bank of America, households with an annual income of less than $50,000 have a roughly 28% credit utilization ratio, compared to around 23% for households with an income higher than $125,000.\n",

      "TransUnion found that over the past year or so, unsecured debt held by subprime borrowers climbed by roughly four percentage points. Observers worry that if economic conditions sour, this debt could quickly become unmanageable, especially since subprime borrowers pay higher interest rates and generally earn less than prime borrowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transunion said the rate of serious delinquency — debt that is past due by 90 days or more — across the consumer credit landscape is within its pre-pandemic range, but has begun to rise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some consider this a troubling sign, especially with more rate hikes on the table between now and the end of the year that will increase borrowers’ interest rates even more. “We are starting to see delinquencies go up a bit, especially around subprime.

      "\n",
      "She first visited a squat – a building occupied by people who don’t own it or pay rent – out of personal interest in April 2013, while she was in London studying for her master’s degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "The notion that this interest could be developed into a wider concept only came along a month or two later, she said.

      "Through the connections she made, she visited six other squats in north and south London. One was in a former fabric warehouse, another in an abandoned garden center, a third in a white-walled former design studio.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As the squatting scene is very interconnected, I came to discover how diverse squats can be, both in their visual appearance and emotional vibe,” she said. “The unusualness of the different places, which may not comply with the idea of home in the common sense, intrigued me and shaped my project.”\n",
      "\n",
      "All the squats Kern visited were in former commercial premises. A law enacted in September 2012 made it illegal to squat in residential properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "With housing costs high in London and affordable options in short supply, squatting can seem an appealing option to some people – although, as Kern points out, it’s not a lifestyle chosen simply because of homelessness or poverty.\n",

      "“I visually tried to convey the very different vibes of the squats that became homes, according to both their residents and the nature of the occupied spaces. Especially for the squat that I stayed at, I focused largely on the communal lifestyle in order to convey a sense of home.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Far from encountering resistance as she ventured into people’s intimate space, Kern says she made many friends. This was in part because she won people’s trust by living among them – but also because her project aimed to celebrate the positive aspects of their lifestyle rather than reinforce the negative stereotypes of squatters as wasters, tax dodgers or down-and-outs.\n",

      "CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "Deep within the Amazonian rainforest of Ecuador live the Huaorani.\n",
      "\n",
      "Photographer Trupal Pandya traveled about 30 hours by air, water and land to reach this native community and take their portraits.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Huaorani, which means “the people” or “human beings,” are believed to have inhabited the rainforest for thousands of years. Until about the 1960s, they never had any contact with the outside world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pandya said there is a contrast between the modernization of the younger generation, who travel to areas outside of their community, and the older generation, who make efforts to maintain their traditional ways of living.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diverse changes have taken place within the community: the introduction of radios within many Huaorani homes, the consumption of food from cities and the adoption of Westernized clothing. For Pandya, these changes were a significant factor in his decision to photograph the Huaorani.\n",
      "\n",
      "Photographer Trupal Pandya Trupal Pandya\n",
      "\n",
      "“The biggest (reason) was to just go out there and photograph the change before everything changes,” Pandya said. “I think if I would have (photographed the Huaorani) 10 years back down the line or a little later than that, I don’t think I would have got what I just got.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Another aspect of modernization has to do with language. Many Huaorani, who for years have only communicated using a regional dialect, now speak the Ecuadorian native language of Spanish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pandya speaks English, so he needed translators to interact effectively. But it is apparent from his experiences with the Huaorani that actions can certainly not only speak louder than words, but be more effectual than words when attempting to convey one’s intentions.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never started photographing when I (first) saw (the Huaorani),” he said. “I didn’t even have my camera. I waited to let them get used to me around them. I gave myself time to get a little easier around them. Even if you cannot talk in the same language, I feel that you definitely connect to them as a human being.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“I think some of them saw the Polaroid for the first time, so they were really happy to see themselves like that,” Pandya said.\n",
      "\n",
      "For his formal portraits, Pandya placed his subjects in front of a solid white background in order to portray the Huaorani in a very direct and concise manner, eliminating the presence of any distractions.\n",

Once they reach the city, they don’t have any resources. Sometimes they don’t even speak Spanish; they speak Quechua, Aymara or other dialects.\n",
      "\n",
      "For leukemia, the most frequent cancer in kids, the first treatment is about six months. But to stay here is too expensive. Sometimes families, they have to sell everything they have. They feel helpless. They feel really alone. They either have to make it work and stay, or they make the difficult trip back home without their children receiving full treatment.\n",

      "CNN: What kind of environment have you created at the shelter?\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I don’t want it to feel like a house, I want it to feel like a home. In the shelter we don’t have TV because I prefer to talk to the kids and teach them how to create things. I want them to use their imagination.\n",

      "\n",
      "Combining his business savvy with an ambitious nonprofit model, in 2007 he co-founded STREETS International, based in Hoi An. The organization provides at-risk young people with a rigorous 18-month training program, preparing them for careers in Vietnam’s booming culinary and hospitality industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "“(They) come from the whole country with all kinds of very, very difficult paths,” Bermas said. “We offer them a structured program and a very rich apprenticing experience.”\n",
      "\n",
      "STREETS’ participants range in age from 16 to 22. The group provides housing, meals, medical care, clothing and support services to help trainees gain skills and confidence for employment at top resorts.\n",

      "\n",
      "CNN: Who are the young people applying to your program?\n",
      "\n",
      "Bermas: All the young people in our program come from poverty – without enough to eat, without electricity and plumbing. From leprosy villages, from HIV backgrounds; some have been trafficked, sometimes more than once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Part of the process of selecting and getting to know the trainees is that we visit wherever they’re from – the home, in many cases the orphanage, the NGO, the isolated village, sometimes even a street corner. We want to know the most about them we possibly can, how difficult their conditions have been and how they have been wounded by life. Or what support there is. It’s a great resource to a young person’s development in our program.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the first real chance for many (of them) to transition from poverty and life on the streets to the dignity of self-sufficiency that comes with a successful career. You shouldn’t discount a young person’s future because of their past, no matter how dire it’s been.\n",
      "\n",
      "CNN: You’ve created an extensive program. Besides the hands-on culinary and hospitality training, what else is involved?\n",
      "\n",
      "Bermas: There’s a whole team of colleagues, educators and professionals who have worked developing all this. We have daily curriculums and lesson plans, from the first day to the last day – designed to deliver quite sophisticated, substantive material.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a computer language lab. We have tutoring every day of the week. English language instruction is a big part. And a whole array of life skills, from hygiene to CPR, budgeting and banking, physical exercise and being healthy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depending on which track the trainees are going, they have classroom experience in a small teaching kitchen if they’re becoming professional chefs, or in the classroom to learn about hospitality and service. And our three eateries have many purposes; each one brings a different set of skills for apprenticing.\n",
      "\n",
      "CNN: You left Manhattan behind to do this. Why did you decide to move to Vietnam?\n",
      "\n",
      "Bermas: The truth is, the early vision was that I would work with colleagues and assemble a team here. And I could travel back and forth and make sure everything was going well.\n",
      "\n",
      "It became clear very early on that if I was to really realize this ambition on behalf of the young people in the program, I would have to be here and do it. It was probably the best, if not certainly the most meaningful, decision I’ve made in my adult life.\n",
      "\n",
      "This work at STREETS is never easy, but it’s important. I know now that I need to be sure there is a STREETS around 10 years from now.\n",
      "\n",
      "CNN: You’ve kept your focus on the local community. How have they embraced you?\n",

      "The day we opened the restaurant – we’d been working so hard to open, to get this thing going – and I came down the street, and there were so many of these big, beautiful wreaths full of flowers that said in Vietnamese, “Congratulations” and “Welcome.” And who had sent them? All the local shops and friends we had made. I was so touched by this.\n",

      "CNN Hero Brisa De Angulo CNN\n",

      "His threats to hurt other family members silenced her. She fell into a deep depression, dropped out of school and developed an eating disorder. She made multiple suicide attempts.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she finally gained the courage to tell her parents about the abuse, they reported it to the police and took the case to court. But they had trouble finding a lawyer willing to take the case. Members of her community worked to silence her. Her home was set on fire twice, and people tried to run her down with their cars.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There was a lot of pressure for me to stay silent, but I just couldn’t stay silent,” said De Angulo, now 30. “I found out that I wasn’t alone, that there were tons of girls that were also being sexually abused, and I had to do something.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the 12 countries that make up South America, Bolivia has the highest rates of sexual violence against women – with seven in 10 women experiencing it in their lifetime.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2004, at 17 years old, De Angulo established Fundación Una Brisa de Esperanza – or A Breeze of Hope Foundation. At its center in Cochabamba, Bolivia, the group provides free and comprehensive psychological, legal, medical and social services for child and adolescent survivors of sexual abuse.\n",

      "CNN spoke with De Angulo about her work. Below is an edited version of the conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "CNN: Sexual violence has long been prevalent in Bolivia. What are the cultural stereotypes you’re working to combat?\n",
      "\n",
      "Brisa De Angulo: We see it a lot in Bolivia, that a woman is seen as having less value than men, and that starts even before the baby is born. If it’s a boy, then you’re in this culture of being more aggressive, the one who has control. If you’re a girl, then you’re this one who has to be submissive, not make problems and sit quietly. Even from a very young age, their path is already set.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to start changing that mentality so that they can be born in a context where they will be seen as equal. One of our most powerful ways of challenging the machismo culture is to work with pregnant women, to work with that family, to start challenging the stereotypical roles.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also work a lot with prevention by giving workshops, training people – people from government, police officers, judges, prosecutors, children in school.\n",

      "\n",
      "De Angulo: When I went to the authorities, I was blamed for what happened to me, I was questioned for many hours. I was told that I was insensitive for wanting to put a man in jail, for wanting to destroy my family. I was one of the first adolescents in Bolivia to take my case to court, but the judges didn’t want to take my case.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we started the program, the conviction rate for sexual crimes was .02 percent. From the hundreds of cases that we’ve taken to court, we have a 95 percent conviction rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was taking my case to court, at the time, it was normal for an aggressor to question the victim on trial. It wasn’t a lawyer, it wasn’t the judge; it was the aggressor. Through our work, we’ve proved that that is a human rights violation and have changed the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another law is that if the aggressor married the victim, you couldn’t take the aggressor to court for rape. That was being used to marry a 13-year-old with a 40-year-old just to make sure that this man will never be taken to court for rape crimes. Thanks to all our work and our push to the government, we have been able to overturn this law.\n",

I started telling my story and asking people if they would join me on a walk against sexual violence and use a blue ribbon, meaning that you were against sexual violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "(The first year) I thought there were only going to be about 20 people who would join me. But that day, thousands of people showed up with a blue ribbon. August 9 was later declared the National Day Against Sexual Violence in Bolivia. Now thousands of people all around the country, in the most remote communities, march on August 9.\n",

      "In Svay Pak, a notorious child sex trafficking hub in Phnom Penh, Sorvino met Kieu, who was then around 14 years old. She had been rescued from sex trafficking by Agape International Missions (AIM), a non-profit for trafficked and at risk children and teenagers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kieu told of how she had been sold aged 12 by her mother to a Khmer man of “maybe more than 50” who had three children of his own, Sorvino explained in her Cambodia journal: “The price set in advance for her virginity: $1,500, though she was ultimately only given $1,000, of which she had to give $400 to the woman who brought her to the man. Her mother used the money to pay down a debt and for food for the fish they raise under their floating house – their primary income source.\n",

But now I know the job was not good for me.’ After she lost her virginity to the man, she felt ‘very heartbroken.’ Her mother supposedly felt bad too, but still sent her to work in a brothel. Kieu said she did not want to go, but had to. She said, ‘They held me like I was in prison.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "She was kept there for three days, raped by three to six men a day. When she returned home, her mother sent her away for stints in two other brothels, including one 400 kilometers away on the Thai border.

      "\n",
      "Sorvino says the film has raised awareness of the issue of child sex trafficking in Svay Pak and Cambodia, helping to raise funds for AIM to build a school that, when completed, will offer hope for more than 1,000 children in the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Primary and especially secondary education is extremely important in preventing trafficking,” she says. “It allows children to develop critical thinking skills to be able to defend themselves from traffickers and to have the skills that will enable them to have gainful employment to be able to support their families in other ways than being sexually exploited.”\n",

      "Pariyar was discharged and sent home with about 20,000 Nepali rupees – less than one percent of the agreed amount – and a promise he would have the rest shortly.\n",

      "He never received any more money and never found the trafficker.\n",

      "Photographs of the recipient and the relative, who would be the legitimate donor, were not included in the letter until recently.\n",

      "Title:  Guatemala: Gender-based violence at epidemic levels\n",
      "News:  Editor’s Note: CNN’s Julie Guinan went to Guatemala, as part of a CARE Learning Tour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Story highlights Gender-based violence is at epidemic levels in Guatemala According to the United Nations, two women are killed in Guatemala every day Five abuse survivors known as La Poderosas have been appearing in a play based on their real life stories\n",
      "\n",
      "CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "For 12 years Adelma Cifuentes felt worthless, frightened and alone, never knowing when her abusive husband would strike.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as a young mother in rural Guatemala with three children and barely a third grade education, she thought there was no way out.\n",
      "\n",
      "What began as psychological torment, name-calling and humiliation turned into beatings so severe Cifuentes feared for her life. One day, two men sent by her husband showed up at her house armed with a shotgun and orders to kill her. They probably would have succeeded, but after the first bullet was fired, Cifuentes’ two sons dragged her inside. Still, in her deeply conservative community, it took neighbors two hours to call for help and Cifuentes lost her arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the abuse didn’t stop there. When she returned home, Cifuentes’ husband continued his attacks and threatened to rape their little girl unless she left. That’s when the nightmare finally ended and her search for justice began.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guatamala’s past still haunts\n",
      "\n",
      "Cifuentes’ case is dramatic, but in Guatemala, where nearly 10 out of every 100,000 women are killed, it’s hardly unusual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many women in Guatemala's patriarcal socity are trapped in a cycle of violence. CARE/Josh Estey\n",
      "\n",
      "A 2012 Small Arms Survey says gender-based violence is at epidemic levels in Guatemala and the country ranks third in the killings of women worldwide. According to the United Nations, two women are killed there every day.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many reasons why, beginning with the legacy of violence left in place after the country’s 36-year-old civil war. During the conflict, atrocities were committed against women, who were used as a weapon of war. In 1996, a ceasefire agreement was reached between insurgents and the government. But what followed and what remains is a climate of terror, due to a deeply entrenched culture of impunity and discrimination. Military and paramilitary groups that committed barbaric acts during the war were integrated back into society without any repercussions. Many remain in power, and they have not changed the way they view women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some 200,000 people were either killed or disappeared during the decades-long conflict, most of them from indigenous Mayan populations. Nearly 20 years later, according to the Security Sector Reform Resource Centre, levels of violent crime are higher in Guatemala than they were during the war. But despite the high homicide rate, the United Nations estimates 98% of cases never make it to court. Women are particularly vulnerable because of a deep-rooted gender bias and culture of misogyny. In many cases, femicide – the killing of a woman simply because of her gender – is carried out with shocking brutality with some of the same strategies used during the war, including rape, torture and mutilation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Explosion in violence\n",
      "\n",
      "Mexican drug cartels, organized criminal groups and local gangs are contributing to the vicious cycle of violence and lawlessness. Authorities investigating drug-related killings are stretched thin, leaving fewer resources to investigate femicides. In many cases, crime is not reported because of fear of retaliation. Many consider the Guatamalen National Civil Police, or PNC, corrupt, under-resourced and ineffective. Even if a case does get prosecuted, according to Human Rights Watch, the country’s weak judicial system has proved incapable of handling the explosion in violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prevailing culture of machismo\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps one of the biggest challenges facing women in Guatemala is the country’s deeply rooted patriarchal society.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to María Machicado Terán, the representative of U.N. women in Guatemala, “80% of men believe that women need permission to leave the house, and 70% of women surveyed agreed.” This prevailing culture of machismo and an institutionalized acceptance of brutality against women leads to high rates of violence. Rights groups say machismo not only condones violence, it places the blame on the victim.\n",
      "\n",
      "Make an impact: Help stop gender-based violence CARE provides medical, legal, psychosocial and protection services to those experiencing violence U.S. National Committee for UN Women promotes social, political and economic equality for women and girls\n",
      "\n",
      "The political will to address violence against women is slow to materialize.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Politicians don’t think women are important,” says former Secretary General of the Presidential Secretariat for Women Elizabeth Quiroa. “Political parties use women for elections. They give them a bag of food and people sell their dignity for this because they are poor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lack of education is a major contributor to this poverty. Many girls, especially in indigenous communities don’t go to school because the distance from their house to the classroom is too far.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quiroa says “They are subject to rape, violence and forced participation in the drug trade.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Signs of progress\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the situation for girls and women in Guatemala is alarming, there are signs the culture of discrimination may be slowly changing. With the help of an organization known as CICAM, or Centro de Investigación, Cifuentes was finally able to escape her husband and get the justice she deserved. He is now spending 27 years behind bars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cifuentes is using her painful past to provide hope and healing to others through art.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 2008, she and four other abuse survivors known as La Poderosas, or “The Powerful,” have been appearing in a play based on their real life stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five Guatemalan abuse survivors known as La Poderosas or \"The Powerful\" share their stories and help other women get support. CARE/Josh Estey\n",
      "\n",
      "The show not only empowers other women and discusses the problem of violence openly, but it also offers suggestions for change. And it’s having an impact. Women have started breaking their silence and asking where they can get support. Men are reacting, too. One of the main characters, Lesbia Téllez, says during one presentation, a man stood up and started crying when he realized how he had treated his wife and how his mother had been treated. He said he wanted to be different.\n",
      "\n",
      "The taboo topic of gender-based violence is also being acknowledged and recognized in a popular program targeting one of Guatemala’s most vulnerable groups, indigenous Mayan girls. In 2004, with help from the United Nations and other organizations, the Population Council launched a community-based club known as Abriendo Oportunidades, or “Opening Opportunities”. The goal is to provide girls with a safe place to learn about their rights and reach their full potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senior Program Coordinator Alejandra Colom says the issue of violence is discussed and girls are taught how to protect themselves. “They then share this information with their mothers and for the first time, they realize they are entitled to certain rights.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Colom adds that mothers then become invested in sending their daughters to the clubs and this keeps them more visible and less prone to violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Guatemalan government is also moving in the right direction to address the problem of violence against women. In 2008, the Congress passed a law against femicide. Two years later the attorney general’s office created a specialized court to try femicides and other violent crimes against women. In 2012, the government established a joint task force for crimes against women, making it easier for women to access justice by making sure victims receive the assistance they need. The government has also established a special 24-hour court to attend to femicide cases. On the global front, the International Violence Against Women Act was introduced in the U.S. Congress in 2007; it has been pending ever since. But last week the act was reintroduced in both the House and Senate. If approved, it would make reducing levels of gender-based violence a U.S. foreign policy priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pehaps the most immediate and effective help is coming from International nongovernmental organizations, which are on the front lines of the fight against gender-based discrimination in Guatemala.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adelma Cifuentes shares her story to empower women and bring about awareness of Guatemala's history of gender-based violence. CARE/Josh Estey\n",
      "\n",
      "Ben Weingrod, a senior policy advocate at the global poverty fighting group CARE, says, “We work to identify and challenge harmful social norms that perpetuate violence. Our work includes engaging men and boys as champions of change and role models, and facilitating debates to change harmful norms and create space for more equitable relationships between men and women.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the job is far from over. While there is tempered optimism and hope for change, the problem of gender-based violence in Guatemala is one that needs international attention and immediate action.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cifuentes is finding strength through the theater and the support of other abuse survivors, which has allowed her to move forward. But millions of other women trapped in a cycle of violence are facing dangerous and frightening futures. For them, it’s a race against time and help cannot come soon enough.\n"

GPT Engineers are capable of writing entire website with just a single prompt.
In this video I will show you how to install it on your local PC and how to use it.
This will be a complete step-by-step guide ensuring that you won't face any problems.
So the first question in your mind might be what is GPT engineer.
Well, GPT engineer is similar to Auto GPT but instead of generating text it creates an entire code base for you.
Now here's the mind-blowing part with GPT engineer.
You don't need to be a coding prodigy or spend countless hours writing lines of code.
All you have to do is provide a text prompt with your project idea and this AI genius will ask you questions to clarify the details.
Once it's Crystal Clear on what you want to build it starts generating the entire code base for you.
Talk about a developer's dream come true.
Alright now let's get into the installation process.
To get started with GPT engineer you'll need a few things.
First make sure you have git installed on your system.
Next you'll need the latest version of python the programming language that powers GPT engineer.
If you don't have python installed yet no worries I'll guide you through the process.
Once you have git and python all set up we need to get ourselves a code editor.
Visual Studio code is an excellent choice as it provides a user-friendly environment for coding and debugging.
Plus it has some cool extensions that can enhance your productivity.
So make sure to grab that editor and have it ready to roll.
Now here comes the crucial part you need to register for an open AI account and log in.
OpenAI is the brilliant team behind GPT engineer and they're the ones making this AI magic happen.
Once you're logged in it's time to generate your very own gpt4 API key.
This key will give you access to the incredible power of gpt4 and enable you to create mind-blowing projects with GPT engineer.
Alright folks now that we have all the necessary prerequisites covered it's time to dive into the installation process.
Head over to the GitHub repository for GPT engineer and clone it to your local machine.
Don't worry if you're not familiar with Git I've got your back.
I'll guide you through the process step by step so you'll have GPT engineer ready to roll in no time.
Once you've cloned the repository navigate to the directory in your command line interface.
From there it's time to install the required dependencies.
This will ensure that GPT engineer has all the necessary tools and libraries to work its magic.
Don't worry if it takes a little bit of time trust me it's worth the wait.
Now here's the secret sauce you need to set up your openai API key.
Remember that API kiwi generated earlier.
This is where it comes into play.
By linking your API key with GPT engineer you're granting it access to the incredible power of gpt4.
This is what makes the magic happen so make sure you follow the instructions carefully to get everything set up properly.
Alright we're almost there.
It's time to create a new project.
Think of it as a canvas where you'll paint your coding masterpiece.
Give your project a catchy name and a brief description.
Remember the more details you provide the better GPT engineer can understand your vision.
Now let's fill in the main prompt.
This is where you Unleash Your creativity and describe what you want to build.
Be as detailed as possible but don't worry if you're not a Wordsmith.
GPT engineer will ask you questions to clarify any missing pieces and ensure it understands your project requirements.
It's like having an AI teammate that never misses a beat.
And now my friends it's time to witness the magic.
Run main py space your project anim and watch as GPT engineer generates your entire code base based on your prompt and the clarifications you provided.
And there you have it folks.
Here you can see our project is ready.
Now let's run our calculator app.
You can see our calculator running perfectly.
So what are you waiting for.
Dive into the world of GPT engineer.
Explore its capabilities and let your coding imagination run wild.
I can't wait to see the amazing projects you'll create.

To make your PC use the internet from your iPhone, you can follow these steps:

1. Ensure that your iPhone has a stable internet connection, either through cellular data or Wi-Fi.

2. On your iPhone, enable Personal Hotspot by going to Settings > Personal Hotspot. Toggle the switch to enable it and set a Wi-Fi password if prompted.

3. On your PC, make sure Wi-Fi is enabled and search for available networks. Your iPhone's Personal Hotspot should appear in the list of available networks.

4. Select your iPhone's Personal Hotspot network and enter the Wi-Fi password you set earlier.

5. Once connected, your PC should be able to use the internet through your iPhone's cellular data or Wi-Fi connection.

Note: Keep in mind that using your iPhone's Personal Hotspot may consume cellular data if you're not connected to Wi-Fi. Additionally, some cellular carriers may have limitations or additional charges for using Personal Hotspot, so it's recommended to check with your carrier for any specific details or restrictions.
